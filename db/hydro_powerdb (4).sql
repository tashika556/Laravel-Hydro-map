The transmission line is planned to be built specifically in villages such as the Bajhakhet village. The 220 kV transmission lines is designed to supply electricity generated from Masryangdi into the national transmission system and has been described as a &lsquo;national pride project. The budget for the project is estimated to be around $200000000, and has received financial backing from The European Investment Bank (around 100 million Euro), and Investment from the Nepalese Government, with construction being undertaken by the <a href=\"https://www.lahurnip.org/european-investment-bank-eib-funded-220-kv-power-transmission-line-project-lamjung\" target=\"_blank\">Nepal Electricity Authority</a>. The project has raised concerns due to the impact it will have on indigenous communities upon whose land the transmission lines will be built. In particular, the intimidation tactics employed by police and other public officials, as well as the lack of prior consultation carried out with affected communities in advance of the construction beginning, and the proper obtaining of free prior and informed consent, have been raised as key issues.</p>', '<p>The FPIC and Rights forum is a grassroots network consisting of representatives from indigenous communities who live along the proposed Transmission line route, such as the Ghale, Gurung, Tamang and Bhujel communities. <a href=\"https://www.accountabilitycounsel.org/client-case/nepal-220-kv-marsyangdi-corridor-transmission-line/#:~:text=Accountability%20Counsel%20has%20been%20supporting,in%20their%20pursuit%20of%20justice\" target=\"_blank\">Their communities will be negatively affected should the proposal go ahead</a>. Their request was for the transmission line to be rerouted, so as not to affect the indigenous land, and the culture and environment attached to it. Despite these concerns being voiced by the FPIC and Rights for years, the project has gone ahead. Concerns have been raised regarding what this indicates in terms of free, prior and informed consent, and whether this has been obtained prior to the project beginning. This has led to the EIB withdrawing their funding of the project, following an internal investigation. Other concerns have been raised regarding the threats and intimidation tactics used by police and government officials. These tactics have often been used in retaliation to protests, or to pressure individuals into consenting to them building on their land, using financial coercion to achieve this goal. Community members have been warned by officials that they must accept the project as it is a symbol of national pride. However, the building of the transmission line has often come at a cost of adverse environmental impacts, and the irreversible loss of culture, resources and livelihoods, as has been highlighted by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Furthermore, protests from communities are met with police force. Upon the acquisition of land in Archalbot, NEA officials visited the site with 28 police officers to begin construction to build rings for holding wire on Tower no.33 B and 33 C, but were unable to due to protests. They returned on the 27th April 2022 with around 30 armed police, in order to suppress the protests and build the rings. As of May 2022 it has been reported that tensions have escalated, and communities have experienced physical attacks from the police, and have been arrested for obstructing the construction of the line.</p>', '<p>The FPIC and Rights Forum have submitted petitions to local districts, such as the Besishahar municipality, national authorities and international investors to halt and reroute proceedings. In 2018, they submitted a formal complaint to the EIB, inciting a compliance review that resulted in the EIB suspending funding whilst <a href=\"https://www.lahurnip.org/european-investment-bank-eib-funded-220-kv-power-transmission-line-project-lamjung\">compliance issues regarding consent and inadequate prior consultation were addressed</a>. The EIB offered to faciloitate dialogue and mediation between the NEA and FPIC and Rights forum, which the NEA refused. On the 8th August 2021, the communities submitted an application to the Ministry of Home Affairs through the District Administration Office in Lamung, demanding for the towers to be built on alternative land to avoid the multi-dimensional impact it would have should it be built on indigenous land. The Raut Thok Village communities submitted an application to the NEA Office in Besishahar, asking them not to construct the transmission line in their village. The response was a delegation of Government Officials and Police being sent to the village to pressure the community to accept the project, with the Chief District officer of Lamjung accompanying armed police and NEA officials for a meeting. <a href=\"https://www.accountabilitycounsel.org/2020/10/indigenous-communities-in-nepal-launch-free-prior-and-informed-consent-protocol-for-eib-funded-marsyangdi-corridor-transmission-line/\">Around 25 women and indigenous peoples have been threatened with police action if they do not accept the project</a>. On the 8th December 2021, 14 indigenous communities reiterated complaints to the NEA, this time also about the intimidation that communities have been met with. They requested an investigation into the incident. However, on the 26 April 2022, five transmission towers were built in Dordi Rural Municipality-2, Archalbot. The owners of the land succumbed to financial pressure to accept compensation.</p>', '<p>ILO Convention No. 169 (Ratified by Nepal 2007) * Art 7(1) affirms the rights of Indigenous Peoples &ldquo;to decide their own priorities for the process of development&rdquo; and to &ldquo;participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly&rdquo; * Art 14 (1) mandates recognition of Indigenous Peoples &ldquo;rights of ownership and possession&rdquo; over the lands they &ldquo;traditionally occupy.&rdquo; This includes &ldquo;lands not exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and traditional activities.&rdquo; Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples * A26- asserts the right of Indigenous Peoples to &lsquo;the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired&rsquo; * A 23 affirms the right of indigenous peoples &ldquo;to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their right to development.&rdquo; * A32 tates that &lsquo;States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly in connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other resources&rsquo; * A 28(1) states that &ldquo;indigenous peoples have the right to redress, by means that can include restitution or, when this is not possible, just, fair and equitable compensation, for the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used, and which have been confiscated, taken, occupied, used or damaged without their free, prior and informed consent.&rdquo; * A28(2) states that t &ldquo;unless otherwise freely agreed upon by the peoples concerned, compensation shall take the form of lands, territories and resources equal in quality, size and legal status or of monetary compensation or other appropriate redress.&rdquo; UN Declaration on the Right to Development * A1(1) defines the right to development an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development The Constitution of Nepal * A51(b)(1) requires the Nepalese Government to &lsquo;implement international treaties, agreements to which Nepal is a party&rsquo; * A51(j)(8)- states the necessity to &lsquo;make the indigenous nationalities (Aadibasi Janajati) participate in decisions concerning that community by making special provisions for opportunities and benefits in order to ensure the right of these nationalities to live with dignity, along with their identity, and protect and promote traditional knowledge, skill, culture, social tradition and experience of the indigenous nationalities and local communities&rsquo;</p>', 'The Marsayandi Corridor, particularly in the Lamjang District.', '$200000000 (estimated)', 'Ghale, Gurung, Tamang, Bhujel', 'October 2018', '<p>Nepal Electricity Authority<br />\r\nBesishahar Municipality<br />\r\nMinistry of Home Affairs<br />\r\nChief District Officer of Lamjung District<br />\r\nLamjung District Police Office</p>', '<p>LAHURNIP<br />\r\nAccountability Counsel</p>', '<p>Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders; the Working Group on the issue of human rights and transnational corporations and other business enterprises; <a href=\"https://spcommreports.ohchr.org/TMResultsBase/DownLoadPublicCommunicationFile?gId=27256\">the Special Rapporteur on the right to development and the Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples</a>. <a href=\"https://www.accountabilitycounsel.org/client-case/nepal-220-kv-marsyangdi-corridor-transmission-line/#:~:text=Accountability%20Counsel%20has%20been%20supporting,in%20their%20pursuit%20of%20justice\">Accountability Counsel Case report</a> <a href=\"https://www.lahurnip.org/european-investment-bank-eib-funded-220-kv-power-transmission-line-project-lamjung\">EIB report</a> <a href=\"https://www.accountabilitycounsel.org/2020/10/indigenous-communities-in-nepal-launch-free-prior-and-informed-consent-protocol-for-eib-funded-marsyangdi-corridor-transmission-line/\">Accountability Counsel, FPIC and Rights Forum, LAHURNIP, AIPP and IWGIA joint report</a></p>', '2024-02-28 22:53:11', '2024-05-28 21:59:51'),

It is currently in the planning stage, following a controversial history regarding its planning, funding, and impacts. The project continues to generate controversy now, due to the threat it poses to indigenous lands, and the unacceptable neglect performed by relevant government or independent actors regarding FPIC. This particular Dam is projected to be built in the Sidhulu and Ramechhap districts, and is expected to generate 4.76 billion units of energy. Upon its initial conception, partial funding agreements were made with the ADB, who also agreed to carry out <a href=\"http://www.nepalenergyforum.com/adb-to-step-back-from-sunkoshi-2-and-3/\">feasibility studies and environmental impact assessments</a>. However, opposition to the project arose immediately from members of the Majhi people who live in the affected regions, make a living and have <a href=\"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/multipurpose-development-projects-threaten-submerge-majhi-indigenous-peoples-nepal\">historic cultural and medicinal ties to the river and the land</a>.  Despite continuous protests from the Majhi community, the ADB only withdrew its funding for the project due to clashes with other infrastructure projects. The Japan International Cooperation Agency requested the project be stopped as the reservoirs would inundate the BP and Mid Hill Highways, which were being funded by the Agency. The ADB therefore requested only upon <a href=\"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/multipurpose-development-projects-threaten-submerge-majhi-indigenous-peoples-nepal\">protests from another corporate agency</a>, that alternatives be investigated.  Distressingly, this only halted the procession of the project, as in 2019, <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/nepal-bangladesh-agree-for-joint-investment-in-hydropower-projects-119062200831_1.html\">agreements were made at the Energy Secretary level meeting between Nepal and Bangladesh</a> whereby white papers proposing projects including Sunkoshi-II were accepted.  It is anticipated that Bangladesh will invest $2 billion into various hydropower projects in Nepal, including the Sunkoshi II project, in return for energy generated by the projects once they are completed. This agreement was signed under the <a href=\"https://thenepalweekly.com/2022/03/08/9855/\">BBIN initiative</a>. Currently, further investment is still being secured, however the project is anticipated to cost <a href=\"https://www.nepalindata.com/media/resources/items/13/bSunkoshi-II-Storage-Hydroelectric-Project.pdf\">$1027 million<a/>. The owner of the Sunkoshi-II project is the Nepal Electricity Authority.', 'The project, should it go forward, will submerge the majority of settlements along the river. This predominantly means, but is not limited to, the Mahji indigenous community. Around 6000 households and 400’000 people are at risk of being <a href=\"https://cemsoj.wordpress.com/2021/10/06/nepals-indigenous-majhi-communities-demand-cancellation-of-sunkoshi-2-hydropower-project/\">displaced</a> across the two districts.  The large-scale displacement could wipe out the entire identity and language of the community itself, since <a href=\"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/multipurpose-development-projects-threaten-submerge-majhi-indigenous-peoples-nepal\">displacement often leads to dispersal</a>.  Furthermore, the occupations of fishing and boating, the medicinal herbs they harvest along the river, the ancestral lands and the cultural practices that come with it will all be submerged. The Mahji are one of 59 communities identified as <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/linked-documents/47036-001-nep-ippfab.pdf\">highly marginalised</a>. Their separation from Nepalese society means that their integration as a result of forced displacement would be all the more challenging. Despite this, the government has scarcely acknowledged the risks posed to the community as a result of the project, meaning that practices associated with the river, such as the hugely significant cremation of their dead, are being overlooked and unrecognised. No free, prior or informed consent  has been attained, and <a href=\"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/multipurpose-development-projects-threaten-submerge-majhi-indigenous-peoples-nepal\">the Environmental Impact Assessment has not been made publicly available in Mahji</a>, therefore many members of the community still do not know what the contents of the assessment says.  Furthermore, as a result of their marginalisation, and lack of common language, few members of the community have registered land in their name. Despite this, the historical nature of the community and its ties to the land means they are entitled to compensation and consultation in international law. Therefore the lack of both of these issues is a direct violation of their rights under international law.', 'Numerous attempts to advocate on the behalf of the Majhi Tribe, both in the form of written and physical protest, have been made. The Sunkoshi Marine Diversion Project Affected Committee has been mobilised and has written a 13 point demand to the Ramechhap District administration office, and delivered it by hand on the 3rd October 2021 also to the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation and the Office of the Prime Minister. One of the demands was to make the EIA public in the Mahji language, another being that they are meaningfully consulted, and a field survey be carried out with participation of affected community members. The letter was also handed to the Director General of the Department of Electricity, who stated that the project was in the phase of its EIA, which community members would be consulted for. Another letter demanding the cessation of the project was sent by the committee on the 30th september 2021 to the Chief District Officer of Ramechhap, and the Mayor of the Manthali Municipality. On the 4th October, Mahiji representatives met with Nepal’s Prime Minister to hand over the demand letter, and submitted the same letter to the National Human Rights Commission and the Indigenous Nationalities Commission. There has been little response, and consultation has still not occurred. Furthermore, drones have been flown over the villages and around the affected area, to carry out surveys without dispatching individuals to the area, therefore avoiding physical interactions with affected communities, where they may be able to vocalise their concerns. \r\n\r\nProtests have been met with apathy from government officials. The Nepal Majhi Womans Association has raised awareness and rallied support within affected communities and at a national level. However, despite the support they have garnered, they have received no response from government officials. On the 30th September, village members from all over Ramechhap and Sidhuli held a protest whereby they wore traditional dress and played their music on traditional instruments, chatting for the annulment of any plans for Sunkoshi-II. However, the assurance that their demands were taken seriously, as assured by the Chief District Officer of Ramechhap, has yet to be proven, as no amendment to the project plan has been made.', 'ILO

The Kavre district is home to Tamang Indigenous communities.  According to the reports from the Department of Power Development, the technical study of the project, drawing design, geological survey, topography survey, cost estimation of the project, economic and financial analysis, biological and social studies have been performed and completed.  This particular storage project is part of a wider agreement between Bangladesh and Nepal and was confirmed in a meeting that involved the Secretary of the Ministry of Electricity, Energy and Mineral Resources of Bangladesh, and the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation of Nepal, the Department of Electricity Development and the Nepal Electricity Authority.  The Ministry of Forests and Environment has determined the scope of the EIA, and will has confirmed their approval of the EIA report regarding the plans for Sunkoshi III.  The feasibility study of the project is in its final stage, and construction is soon to begin, currently  consultations must be carried out with project affected local individuals and communities, before the final findings of the reports can be considered.  The project is expected to commence from 2029.  The predicted price of the project is $1’458’000’000, and it is clearly intended to be a cross border project, whereby Bangladesh will fund the construction of the dam that will funnel electricity back over the border upon completion, however, specific financing sources have yet to be identified.  Proposals for sponsorship from Bangladeshi conglomerates Summit Group and United Group have been made, however other financiers have yet to be confirmed.  Similarly, the findings of the EIA have only recently been published', 'The project is anticipated to have significant consequences on the land and residents around it. A total of 1’364’022 acres of land will be utilized in the construction of Sunkoshi III. This will encompass several rivers and lakes. Not only this, but 3’600 households are predicted to lose their land and homes at least partially.   However, it seems in this case that the rights of potentially displaced locals have been respected insofar as this project has been carried out. Feasibility reports and EIA’s have reportedly been carried out with consultation with local communities.  Furthermore, plans for relocation have also been put forward by a study carried out by JICA.  However, little discussion has been had around compensation for displaced communities. Promises have been made stating that the affected area will receive Rs 500 million annually from project royalties.   The specifics of this pledge have not been confirmed. Locals are reportedly enthused about the prospect of construction beginning.  This contrasts with many other community responses to hydropower projects and their process of construction, even from communities affected by projects nearby.  Perhaps this speaks to the ability of communities to compromise should they be meaningfully consulted and compensated, once their FPIC is obtained. It is however worth bearing in mind that a further consequence of the project’s completion is an increased risk of flooding of communities in the district as a result of the dam’s presence.', 'N/A', 'N/A', 'Temal Rural Municipality-9', '$1’458’000’000', 'Communities within Kavre, Ramechhap, Sindhupalchok, Dolakha, and Sindhuli districts, including the Tamang Indigenous community', '1985', 'The Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation of Nepal, the Department of Electricity Development, The Nepal Electricity Authority, and the Ministry of Forests and Environment.', 'N/A', 'MyRepublica Report: Cost of Sunkoshi-III hydropower project estimated at Rs 160 billion\r\nhttps://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/cost-of-sunkoshi-iii-hydropower-project-estimated-at-rs-160-billion/\r\nThe Annual Kathmandu Conference on Nepal and the Himalayas Report\r\nhttps://annualconference.soscbaha.org/topic/dashain-celebration-among-the-tamang-community-and-producing-doxa-an-indigenous-perspective/\r\nSpotlight Nepal Report: Sunkoshi-III Reservoir Power Project is Viable\r\nhttps://www.spotlightnepal.com/2022/07/04/sunkoshi-iii-reservoir-power-project-viable-study/\r\n\r\nNepal Energy Forum: Bangladesh Serious to Invest in Sunkoshi-III Reservoir Hydropower Project\r\nhttp://www.nepalenergyforum.com/bangladesh-serious-to-invest-in-sunkoshi-iii-reservoir-hydropower-project/\r\n\r\nThe Kathmandu Post: Nepal-Bangladesh joint venture project gets environmental nod\r\nhttps://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/12/07/nepal-bangladesh-joint-venture-project-gets-environmental-nod\r\nPowerTechnology Sunkoshi-III profile. \r\nhttps://www.power-technology.com/marketdata/power-plant-profile-sunkoshi-3-nepal/?cf-view\r\n\r\nOnlineKhabar report: Joint investment of Nepal and Bangladesh in Sunkoshi-III, signed within 6 months \r\nhttps://www.onlinekhabar.com/2023/05/1307984\r\nBangladesh Working Gorup on Ecology and Development Sunkoshi-III profile\r\nhttps://bwged.blogspot.com/p/sunkoshi-iii-683-mw-hydropower-plant.html\r\nNepal Infrastructure report: The sunkoshi-III project enjoys political support\r\nhttps://nepalinfrastructure.com/7886/\r\nNational Indigenous Womans Forum Report\r\napwld.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Nepal-Land-FPAR-NIWF.pdf', '2024-02-28 23:02:00', '2024-02-28 23:02:00'),

According to the draft environmental impact assessment report published in July 2019, except for irrigation, 28.62 MW of electricity is also aimed to generate by constructing a 12-meter-high dam on Sunkoshi river of Sunkoshi rural municipality ward no. 6 and releasing the water to the river of Marin river of Kusumtar in ward no. 2 of Kamalamai through a 13.1 km long tunnel. A reservoir will be constructed on 312 hectares of land within Sunkoshi rural municipality ward no. 6, Khadadevi rural municipality ward no. 4 and Manthali municipality ward no. 6 under the project. In addition, its dam and sediment pond will lie in Sunkoshi rural municipality ward no. 7 and other structures in Kamalamai Municipality ward no. 2.\r\nA total cost of the project is Rs. 86.51 billion which is divided as Rs. 37.20 billion for irrigation and Rs. 46.19 billion for hydropower. According to the Draft Environmental Impact Assessment Report, there is a total population of 15,872 and 3,026 households in the villages and municipalities of the project area. In which, there are 22.265 per cent Tamang and 20.63 per cent Chhetri, followed by Magar and Brahmins, furthermore, the Indigenous Majhi community stands to be affceted by the project.', 'A total of 345.6 hectares of land is required for the project, of which 339.20 hectares are required permanently and 6.39 hectares for temporary use. Out of the land to be used permanently, 69.46 hectares of private land is with land ownership certificate, 18.37 hectares of land is without land ownership certificate and the remaining 251.34 hectares is government land, out of which forest area 4.48 hectares, community forest 2.1 hectare, 50.37 hectare covered by the river and 182.63 hectares is riverside.\r\nSimilarly, 4,234 people from 532 households will be directly affected by the project due to land acquisition. According to the Environmental Impact Assessment Report, the project will directly affect 43 houses, 30 cowsheds, 3 generator houses, 15 underground dug wells, 2 solar panels and 1 drinking water supply system operated from it. About 90 percent of the people living in the inundated area belongs to the Indigenous Majhi community. In the inundation area, 24 houses, 19 tents, 3 water pumping houses, 15 tubewells, two small solar panels, tubewells of Khadadevi village drinking water project, power house and solar panel, about 794 m of irrigation canals and two suspension bridges will have a direct adverse effect from the project as per the report. The affected communities in the Inundation area said they had no information about the household questionnaire or public hearing as mentioned in the environmental impact assessment report. In addition, the affected community has also claimed that the land and houses to be inundated by the project have not been inspected. According to Urbe Majhi of Masantar, who was directly affected by the project, the land to be acquired during the construction of the project has not been clearly mapped. However, false assurances have been given that only half of his land will be included in the project and the rest will not be inundated.\r\nIn addition, the report does not appear to have a slight study on the social, cultural, historical and other multidimensional aspects of the indigenous peoples. Rajagaon, located at Khadadevi Village Municipality ward no. 4 of Ramechhap district, is the historical and ancestral home of the Majhi community. Rajagaon means the village where the king lives and here the ruins of the palace of king of Majhi community, the Mandare, remains.', 'Since the representation of the Majhi community has been overlooked and underprioritized, the community ahs responded by forming a committee to try and force project officials to recognize their interests. As the Sunkosho Marine Diversion Project Affected Committee states, they are not agains development, but they demand that they not be displaced, and that the lack of information and involvement regarding the effects and potential benefits of the project be rectified.   The committee has subsequently released a 13 point demand list to the relevant authorities. These demands include that any relevant information or assessment report findings be made available and in a language understandable to affected communities, that meaningful consultation with the Majhi community be pursued, especially by the Compensation Determination Committee, land for land compensation be offered where necessary and that profits from the projects be used for the benefit of affected indigenous groups, amongst other demands.  The demands were accompanied by threats that failure to comply or acknowledge them would result in further protests. There has been little reported on the response of the authorities, however, we know that the project has been facing other issues, chiefly lack of funding, and lack of payment for the China Oversees Engineering Group, who won the contract for the construction of the Project’s tunnel in 2021.', 'Under Nepal’s Treaty Act, 2047 (1990), the provisions of a treaty that Nepal has signed are enforceable as national law, and prevail in case of inconsistency with the latter. The country is therefore bound by the provisions of the Convention no. 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP), among other international law instruments. Taking this into account, many rights of the indigenous peoples and affected communities were violated as a result of the project:\r\n\r\n-        Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC): it is a specific right granted by UNDRIP and that aligns to IPs universal rights to self determination. This principle allows them to withhold or withdraw consent regarding projects impacting their territories, and allows them to engage in negotiations, shape, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the projects. It is mentioned in UNDRIP in regards to relocation, dispossession of lands, cultural, religious or spiritual property, cooperation, development and more; and has been violated in several occasions as a result of the project. \r\n-        Right to not be forcibly removed from one’s land or territory (UNDRIP, art 10): “No relocation shall take place without free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned and after agreement on just and fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of return”. \r\n-        Right to inclusive and meaningful consultation. The ILO Convention establishes the right to consultation to peoples concerned through appropriate procedures regarding measures that may affect them directly, as well as participation in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly (Arts 6.1.a and 7.1). Furthermore, UNDRIP establishes the right to participate in decision-making in matters which would affect their rights (art. 18), as well as the right to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their rights to development (art. 23). \r\n-        Right to livelihood and means of sustenance: UNDRIP, in art. 20 establishes the right for IPs to be secure in the enjoyment of their own means of subsistence and development, and to engage freely in all their traditional and other economic activities. Furthermore, when deprived of such means, they are entitled to a just and fair redress. \r\n-        Right to fair compensation and redress: protected by art. 8.2 UNDRIP, for deprivation of cultural values, dispossession from lands, territories or resources and forced population transfers. \r\n-        Right to decide regarding their development: art. 7.1. ILO protects the right to decide their priorities for development, allowing them to participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly. \r\n-        Right not to be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of their culture (art. 8.1 UNDRIP), and to maintain, protect and develop manifestations of their culture (art. 11 UNDRIP), and to maintain, protect and have access to their religious and cultural sites (art. 12 UNDRIP).', 'Sunkoshi rural municipality ward no. 6, Khadadevi rural municipality ward no. 4 and Manthali municipality ward no. 6', 'N/A', 'Tamang, Chhetri, Magar, Brahmins, Majhi COmmunitites', '2019', 'The Government of Nepal', 'N/A', 'N/A', '2024-02-28 23:03:47', '2024-02-28 23:03:47');

The project is designed to meet the electricity demand in Nepal, providing alternatives to fossil fuel based power generation.', 'The Tanahu Hydropower Project is a storage type hydropower project with an installed capacity of 140 MW and an estimated average annual energy generation of 587.7 GWh (years 1-10) and 489.9 GWh (year 11 onwards). The project is designed to meet the electricity demand in Nepal, providing alternatives to fossil fuel based power generation. It consists of a <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/projects/43281-013/main\">proposed</a> 140 metre high hydropower dam, with a 25 kilometre reservoir sited along the Seti River, near the town of Damauli in the Tanahu District, about 150 km west of Kathmandu. It also involves rural electrification and community development in the project area, as well as a reform and restructuring plan for the national utility, the NEA. The Project area covers two urban municipalities, Vyas and Bhimad, and two rural municipalities, Rishing and Myagde. The total cost of the project is estimated around 505 million dollars, and it is financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). \r\n\r\nAlthough the project aims to harness Nepal’s hydropower potential and contribute to its energy needs, it has brought numerous challenges and adverse effects for the indigenous communities residing in the project vicinity. \r\n\r\nOne of the major concerns is the displacement of indigenous communities from their ancestral lands and the subsequent disruption of their livelihoods. Indeed, the EIA Addendum of 2012 identified 838 households as Project Affected Families, whose land or property was acquired temporarily or permanently, among which 86 were from the inundation and risk zone of the reservoir area and considered relocates, completely displaced from their ancestral lands. Many of these communities rely on agriculture, fishing, and other activities related to natural resources. The construction of the hydropower project can lead to the loss of productive lands and natural resources, resulting in a decline in livelihood opportunities for these communities. The displacement and resettlement often disrupt existing economic systems and can force communities into unfamiliar economic activities or dependency on external sources for their livelihoods. This can perpetuate cycles of poverty and exacerbate existing socio-economic disparities within affected communities. \r\n\r\nThe process of resettlement and compensation has often been contentious, with communities demanding fair treatment and adequate compensation for their losses, which they often have struggled to obtain. Moreover, the participation and consultation of indigenous communities in the decision-making processes related to the project have been inadequate. Their right to free, prior and informed consent has often been disregarded, marginalising their voices and undermining their authority to decide and shape the project’s development, which works against their rights enshrined in the UNDRIP. Indeed, communities and supporting organisations have often protested about this. The FPIC process should involve the engagement of meaningful consultations, providing accurate and understandable information about the potential impacts and risks, and the creation of an environment where community members can express their opinions and concerns. Then, it should be an inclusive and transparent mechanism that allows indigenous communities to participate at all stages of the project, including planning, implementation and beyond, and ensure that they have an opportunity to voice their perspectives and concerns regarding potential impacts on their lives and territories, and ultimately give or withdraw their consent.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, the project also <a href=\"https://cemsoj.wordpress.com/2016/12/19/tanahu-hydropower-project-affected-communities-submit-26-point-memorandum-to-energy-minister/\">erodes</a> traditional knowledge, practices, and cultural heritage, as communities have rich cultural traditions closely tied to their natural surroundings. This includes rituals, ceremonies, and traditional ecological knowledge, which are disrupted by the project in the form of loss of access to sacred sites, forests and water sources, which can significantly impact the transmission of knowledge. Ultimately, the loss of cultural heritage can have long-lasting implications for indigenous communities as it affects their resilience and identity.', 'As per the <a href=\"https://thl.com.np/#/about\">Land Acquisition Act</a>, 2034, section 3, the Government of Nepal can acquire any land at any place for any public purpose, subject to compensation under the Act.\r\nHowever, the act also provides for preliminary action (art. 6) and compensation for losses on land acquisition, which shall be paid (art. 7). Furthermore, article 11 establishes the right of landowners to file complaints after the issued notice of their land being acquired. \r\nUnder this Act, compensation for the land shall be paid in cash and a committee consisting of an officer appointed by the Chief District Officer, Land Revenue Office, Project Head if the land is acquired for the project and a representative of the concerned village or municipality, as provided in article 13. Article 14 provides that land can be given instead of land in case of acquisition of land as per the Act, if the person who owns the entire land in the place where such land has been acquired wants to take land elsewhere as compensation. If any publicly owned land, or sold by the Government of Nepal as per prevailing law, the Government may give such land in compensation. \r\n\r\nInitially, it was estimated that around <a href=\"https://cemsoj.wordpress.com/human-rights-advocacy/tanahu-hydropower-project/\">838 households</a> were affected by the construction of the hydropower project, the majority of them being indigenous peoples. Being dispossessed from their lands, the project also has <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/43281/43281-013-emr-en_8.pdf\">major</a> impacts on the livelihoods of affected people, which are mainly agriculture, fishing, fuel wood and fodder collection. \r\n\r\nThe Majhi, Bote, Danuwar and Darai are indigenous and marginalised groups whose ancestral profession is fishing. However, this means of subsistence is affected by hydropower projects because they involve damming and alteration of river flows, which can significantly affect the aquatic ecosystem, fish populations and their habitats, as well as disrupt migration routes and breeding patterns of fish. This can lead to reduced fish populations and ultimately impact on fishermen’s source of income and food security. Furthermore, the displacement of indigenous communities from ancestral lands disrupts farming activities and causes the loss of their primary source of income. Hydropower projects involve the alteration of natural water flow patterns, which can cause changes in water availability, and thus adversely impacting agriculture. \r\nLocal communities have continuously protested, among other issues, about the lack of compensation due to land loss, and, if given, about their lack of participation in the determination of such compensation, which has been consistently disproportionate and discriminatory. They have also demanded land-for-land and house-per-house compensation, which has not been acquired. Among the issues that arise regarding land loss compensation is the fact that many families have inhabited lands for generations but are not legal owners of such lands, who demand to be recognised as such.', 'After the signing of loans and approval of the project, in 2016, the project affected communities came together under two committees, namely the Tanahu Hydropower Directly Affected Area Concerned Committee and Directly Concerned Inundation Area Conservation Committee, to submit a memorandum with 26 point demands to Tanahu Hydropower Limited (THL) and the NEA, the concerned local and national government authorities and the parliamentarians with copies of it sent to political parties, financiers and media. The memorandum, overall, called for sharing of project information, conduct of meaningful consultations with the affected communities, establishment of local consultation forums, representation of the affected communities in compensation determination, conduct of a re-survey for affected lands that were left out, arrangements for common properties and provision of one house one employment for the affected families, as well as free shares and electricity of the Project. A meeting with both committees was called by the District Administration Office regarding determination of compensation of the affected properties, although it did not result in any agreement. \r\n\r\nMany actions were undertaken by the committees in protest about the compensation. In 2017, they issued a press release restating their major concerns and explaining that compensation had been arbitrarily determined without their participation or concern, and that it was discriminatory. Furthermore, they registered a complaint against the determination of this compensation at Nepal’s Home Ministry, and submitted their memorandum to the National Human Rights Commission. A protest rally and assembly were also carried out, and participated by at least 350 people at the district administration against this decision, and in demand of land for land and house for house compensation, respect for ADB safeguards, and conduct of meaningful consultations. The Committees representatives met, a month later, with the Minister of Home Affairs, who said the provisions of the ADB and EIB safeguards would be implemented, and who asked the THL to revise compensation rates; and the Minister of Energy, who gave assurances to provide compensation to those who don’t have legal ownership of lands. They also met with Nepali congress leaders and THL Managing director and ADB representatives. All in all, THL engaged in negotiations with the two Committees, who ended up signing a 21-point agreement covering 26 point demands, by which the THL agreed to provide cultivation disruption allowances. A group of 31 families from Paltyang and Rishing Patan and six joint owners of a land plot, who were not satisfied with the agreement formed a new committee called Directly Inundation Affected Peoples Collective Rights Protection Committees, and submitted their 12-point demands in a memorandum to the authorities and the THL, and later filed a complaint with the ADB’s Accountability Mechanism, but it was later declared ineligible. Among other forms of advocacy, community-led research was conducted among the Project affected families and found that 75% of them had not been consulted and 84% had not received any compensation. \r\n\r\nIn 2020, a new complaint was filed with the ADB’s Accountability Mechanism and the EIB Complaint Mechanism (EIB-CM), calling for land for land and house for house compensation, re-survey of land left out during the previous land survey, and free, prior and informed consent, among others. This time complaints were acknowledged and admitted, and ended up with the agreement on the conduction of an IPs socio-cultural-economic study and land valuation study.  Also, other Magar and Dalit families sent letters to the THL and the authorities, raising concerns about the lack of information sharing and meaningful consultations, which were unfortunately not acknowledged or responded to. They were finally submitted to the EIB-CM and accepted, and a first joint meeting with the Complainants and THL representatives was organised for July 2022. \r\n\r\nOverall, the affected communities conducted advocacy in two main forms: complaints before the company, its financiers and the authorities, and protests and rallies.', 'Under Nepal’s Treaty Act, 2047 (1990), the provisions of a treaty that Nepal has signed are enforceable as national law, and prevail in case of inconsistency with the latter. The country is therefore bound by the provisions of the Convention no. 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP), among other international law instruments. Taking this into account, many rights of the indigenous peoples and affected communities were violated as a result of the project:\r\n\r\n-        Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC): it is a specific right granted by UNDRIP and that aligns to IPs universal rights to self determination. This principle allows them to withhold or withdraw consent regarding projects impacting their territories, and allows them to engage in negotiations, shape, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the projects. It is mentioned in UNDRIP in regards to relocation, dispossession of lands, cultural, religious or spiritual property, cooperation, development and more; and has been violated in several occasions as a result of the project. \r\n-        Right to not be forcibly removed from one’s land or territory (UNDRIP, art 10): “No relocation shall take place without free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned and after agreement on just and fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of return”. \r\n-        Right to inclusive and meaningful consultation.

The project was first proposed in 2001, and building commenced in 2004. However, the project has been ongoing for decades, due to opposition from locals obstructing building and encouraging contractors to drop the project. Locals around Lalitpur, in particular, <a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/obstruction-in-construction-of-132-kv-chobhar-substation-cleared\">Harisiddhi and Lamatar VDC locals</a> have adamantly refused to relocate or allow building to be carried out on their lands.  This includes <a href=\"\">Shrethsa and Tamang</a> community members.

The Nepalese Electricity Authority has been contracted to undertake the project, which will be <a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/construction-of-eight-high-capacity-substations-underway-in-the-valley\">funded</a> by the NEA, the Nepalese government, the Asian Investment Bank and the Japan International Cooperation Agency', 'The project has taken far longer than originally anticipated to be completed. This is due to huge opposition against the construction of the transmission line, and the impacts it will have on the area and land surrounding it. An underlying theme of the demands of the protesters is that the line be rerouted, and substations be relocated away from affected communities. However, the <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/01/14/nea-and-locals-of-lapsiphedi-reach-agreement-to-calm-situation-over-power-substation\">authorities have insisted</a> that this is not possible in order to effectively provide electricity to the valley.  The arguments made by the affected locals is that the transmission line put in jeopardy the cultural heritage and livelihood of those who live off the land. Another concern that has been repeatedly raised by locals is a lack of proper compensation. Whilst the NEA insists that proper compensation has been afforded to affected communities, the offer made was for 25% of the price of the land. Furthermore, the reasoning is that land has not actively been taken away from many locals, however, they are still <a href=\"http://www.nepalenergyforum.com/land-dispute-delays-thankot-\">affected negatively</a>, as they would be unable to use the land for farming nor building.   The locals are therefore demanding 100%compensation. Though relocation plans were made in 2004 by the AIB, this did not acknowledge all of the negatively affected communities, and only as a result of incessant obstruction have <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/thankot-chapagaon-bhaktapur.pdf\">locals been consulted</a> with regards to the carrying out of the project.  Furthermore, police forces were dispatched to <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/01/14/nea-and-locals-of-lapsiphedi-reach-agreement-to-calm-situation-over-power-substation\">stifle protests</a> throughout the decades that opposition was present at the building sites', 'Over the past two decades, many attempts have been made to bring the injustice that locals were facing to light. Firstly, many <a href=\"http://english.aarthiknews.com/11390-2nea-to-build-high-capacity-power-transmission-line-in-kathmandu\">on site protests</a> have been attended to obstruct the building of pylons and demand that the transmission lines be rerouted.  These protests have eventually resulted in the NEA sitting down with locals to discuss agreements and reach a compromise. Eventually they reached a <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/01/15/lapsephedi-protest-hints-at-challenges-in-expansion-of-transmission-lines\">three point agreement</a>, and locals agreed to ease obstruction.  A coordinate committee was formed to further discuss with locals and form a comprehensive report. One <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/nea-to-expedite-construction-of-132-kv-substation-in-chobhar/?categoryId=opinion\">response</a> from the NEA has been to reroute one of the substations, and with concessional loans from the ADB, build in Chobhar, in order to compromise with the locals who opposed the initial route of the transmission line.  Though obstruction also occurred in response to the new proposed site, a meeting held by the NEA managing director, Kirtipur Municipality Mayor, Ward Chairperson and other local representatives, ended with a compromise whereby residents agreed to end the obstruction.

The Trishuli River holds great significance within the Tamang communities, both culturally, and through historical land ownership of land surrounding the river, around 80 hectares of which will be affected by the project. The Tamang communities right to consultation, and the legal requirement to obtain FPIC from project affected communities, was only sporadically acknowledged and fulfilled by the IFC. For example, consent was only sought from land deprived communities, and excluded those who would not face displacement but would face <a href=\"Lahurnip-aipp-iwgia-report-fpic-for-tamang-in-nepal-eng-2023.pdf\">other negative outcomes</a> through the manipulation of land and water resources they rely on. During negotiations, the Tamang community was <a href=\"https://www.hydropower.org/news/achieving-indigenous-people-e2-80-99s-consent-for-hydropower-in-nepal\">promised</a> new infrastructure for the community\'s benefit, including roads, schools and health services, with the Nepali government pledging Rs140 million on these developments. However, the NWEDC Director Giriraj Adhikari has admitted that no funds for this project have been released, and local activists have highlighted the fact that only 10 out of 21 areas affected by the project will benefit from the current agreement. Furthermore, little compensation has been promised for the damage done to property during construction, and locals land, including grazing areas, forests etc. that are located in areas surrounding the intake and powerhouse have not been accounted for. The construction includes tunnel building, which has destabilised rocks that are at risk of falling onto villages and causing destruction and injury, yet nothing is being done to neutralise the risk or move people to safety. Additionally, some 110 households have been displaced, with little compensation. Finally, though Tamang locals were promised economic promises such as the guarantee of business and job opportunities, the <a href=\"https://nepalitimes.com/here-now/nepal-s-curse-of-the-white-gold?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email\">outsourcing of workers</a> for the project has left many locals jobless with no way of earning money whilst the project continues.', 'The initial communication between the project management and indigenous communities began in 2014, when the IFC found that the project violated their performance standards, as it did not include the participation of indigenous groups affected by the proposed construction. The lack of FPIC from local communities was a barrier to the project’s continuation. However, FPIC was obtained by the NEWEDC from  NEFIN following a series of negotiations. \r\nAs established above, many of the promises made by the NEWEDC have not been fulfilled, therefore further action has begun to be taken by aggrieved members of local communities. Legal support has been sought from LAHURNIP, who carried out initial impact assessments in 2013. Furthermore, locals in Rasuwa have  stormed the project whilst under construction, and have allegedly  assaulted two of the project technicians, as well as the representative of the contractor company. This is said to be in <a href=\"https://english.khabarhub.com/2021/22/221541/\">response</a> to the lack of local employment that was initially promised, but has since not been carried out.', '<u>ILO Convention No. 169 (Ratified by Nepal 2007)</u>\r\n\r\n Art 7(1) affirms the rights of Indigenous Peoples “to decide their own priorities for the process of development” and to “participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly”\r\nArt 14 (1) mandates recognition of Indigenous Peoples “rights of ownership and possession” over the lands they “traditionally occupy.” This includes “lands not exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and traditional activities.”\r\n\r\n\r\n<u>UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People</u>\r\n\r\nA 23 affirms the right of indigenous peoples “to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their right to development.”\r\nA32 states that ‘States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly in connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other resources’\r\nA 28(1) states that “indigenous peoples have the right to redress, by means that can include restitution or, when this is not possible, just, fair and equitable compensation, for the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used, and which have been confiscated, taken, occupied, used or damaged without their free, prior and informed consent.”\r\nA28(2) states that  “unless otherwise freely agreed upon by the peoples concerned, compensation shall take the form of lands, territories and resources equal in quality, size and legal status or of monetary compensation or other appropriate redress.”\r\n\r\n<u>UN Declaration on the Right to Development</u>\r\n\r\nA1(1) defines the right to development an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development\r\nThe Constitution of Nepal\r\nA51(b)(1) requires the Nepalese Government to ‘implement international treaties, agreements to which Nepal is a party’\r\nA51(j)(8)- states the necessity to ‘make the indigenous nationalities (Aadibasi Janajati) participate in decisions concerning that community by making special provisions for opportunities and benefits in order to ensure the right of these nationalities to live with dignity, along with their identity, and protect and promote traditional knowledge, skill, culture, social tradition and experience of the indigenous nationalities and local communities’\r\nLand Acquisition Act 1977\r\nA7- (1) Compensation shall be paid for losses resulting from clearing of crops and trees, and of demolition of walls, etc., or for damage, if any, suffered as a result of the removal or digging of earth, stone, ditches, or boring. \r\n(3) In case the concerned person is not satisfied with the amount of compensation determined under Sub-Section (2), he/she may file a complaint with the chief District Officer on which he/she receives information thereof, and in such cases the decision of the Chief District Officer shall be final.', 'Rashuwa District', '$647.4million', 'Haku, Ramche and Dhunche,Tamang community', 'August 2020', 'Nepal Electricity Authority', 'N/A', 'LAHURNIP Report\r\nhttps://www.lahurnip.org/international-finance-corporation-ifc-financed-216-mw-upper-trishuli-1-hydropower-project-rasuwa\r\nIHA Report\r\nhttps://www.hydropower.org/news/achieving-indigenous-people-e2-80-99s-consent-for-hydropower-in-nepal\r\nNS Energy Report\r\nhttps://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/upper-trishuli-1-hydropower-project/\r\nNepal Times News Report ‘Nepals curse of the white gold’\r\nhttps://nepalitimes.com/here-now/nepal-s-curse-of-the-white-gold?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email\r\nKhabarhub Report ‘Locals in Rasuwa thrash Upper Trishuli-1 Korean contractor’\r\nhttps://english.khabarhub.com/2021/22/221541/\r\nLAHURNIP: An independent assessment on compliance with the IFC performance standards in the Upper-Trishuli-1 hydropelectric project https://www.lahurnip.org/uploads/publication/file/lahurnip-aipp-iwgia-report-fpic-for-tamang-in-nepal-eng-2023.pdf', '2024-03-11 02:38:28', '2024-03-11 02:38:28');

(9, 'Tamakoshi-Kathmandu Transmission Line', '27.6667', '86.0333', 'The Tamakoshi-Kathmandu (T-K) Transmission Line is an important electrical transmission line in Nepal designed to transmit electricity generated from the Tamakoshi Hydropower Project, to the Kathmandu Valley, which is the country’s capital and most populous region.', 'The Tamakoshi-Kathmandu (T-K) Transmission Line is an important electrical transmission line in Nepal designed to transmit electricity generated from the Tamakoshi Hydropower Project, to the Kathmandu Valley, which is the country’s capital and most populous region. The transmission line infrastructure <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/projects/41155-013/main\">consists of high-voltage transmission equipment</a> designed to facilitate the efficient transfer of electricity over long distances, and it operates at voltages of 220 kV. Located in Dolakha District, approximately 80 km northeast of Kathmandu, the Tamakoshi Hydropower Project harnesses the energy of the Tamakoshi River to generate electricity, and is one of Nepal’s largest hydropower plants with an installed capacity of 456 MW. \r\n\r\nThe line will run from eastern Nepal to the east side of Kathmandu, and cover 33 village development committees of six different districts, namely Ramechap, Dolkha, Sindhupalchok, Kavrepalanchok, Bhaktapur and Kathmandu. \r\n\r\nHowever, it is important to note that indigenous communities have raised concerns about the loss of their traditional lands, disruption of cultural practices, and loss of livelihoods associated with the projects. The infrastructure required to complete the project includes a number of substations built to expand the area of electricity transmission, which are often allocated on indigenous lands and settlements. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, there have been concerns about the <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2023/05/24/nea-plans-20-substations-in-kathmandu-valley-but-concerns-over-land-acquisition-remain\">lack of meaningful consultation</a> and participation of IPs in decision-making processes related to the project. One of the problematic areas, for instance, is Bojheni, as around 500 affected households of Indigenous Tamang and other affected locals have opposed the construction of the substation and transmission line since 2015. They claim that the substation at the human settlement is being built without the informed consent of the local people, who, according to the chairperson of Tamang, were emotionally blackmailed. However, their concerns regarding the line’s potential impacts on their lands and livelihoods have often been marginalised and overlooked. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, large-scale projects like the T-K line can raise environmental concerns, including the potential impact on local ecosystems, including forests, water resources, and wildlife habitats. It is necessary to emphasise the need for proper environmental assessment, mitigation measures, and the preservation of IP’s cultural and natural heritage.', 'As per the Land Acquisition Act, 2034, section 3, the Government of Nepal can acquire any land at any place for any public purpose, subject to compensation under the Act.\r\nHowever, the act also provides for preliminary action (art. 6) and compensation for losses on land acquisition, which shall be paid (art. 7). Furthermore, article 11 establishes the right of landowners to file complaints after the issued notice of their land being acquired. \r\nUnder this Act, compensation for the land shall be paid in cash and a committee consisting of an officer appointed by the Chief District Officer, Land Revenue Office, Project Head if the land is acquired for the project and a representative of the concerned village or municipality, as provided in article 13. Article 14 provides that land can be given instead of land in case of acquisition of land as per the Act, if the person who owns the entire land in the place where such land has been acquired wants to take land elsewhere as compensation. If any publicly owned land, or sold by the Government of Nepal as per prevailing law, the Government may give such land in compensation. \r\n\r\nThe Tamakoshi-Kathmandu transmission line project has been a significant concern in relation to the loss of lands and livelihoods of indigenous peoples. Firstly, the project requires the <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/41155-013-nep-ieeab.pdf\">acquisition of land</a> along its route for the construction of infrastructure, including towers, substations, and access roads. This project often leads to the displacement of indigenous communities from their ancestral lands, which are vital for their cultural identity, traditional practices, and livelihoods. Indeed, they often have deep-rooted connections to their lands, and rely on them for subsistence agriculture, grazing, fishing, and other traditional livelihood practices. Loss of <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/41155-013-iee-vol1-01.pdf\">access to fertile lands, forests and water sources</a> can have long term consequences of the communities’ food security and income generation. Therefore, the construction and operation of the line can disrupt such practices, impacting their economic well-being, way of life, and ultimately, their subsistence. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, in cases where land acquisition and displacement occur, there have been issues with the fair and adequate compensation for the affected communities. It is crucial that, if removed from their traditional lands and stripped from their livelihoods, indigenous communities are compensated justly for their losses, provided with appropriate resettlement options and livelihood options. Inadequately tackling these issues can exacerbate economic disparities and hinder the ability of indigenous communities to rebuild their lives and sustain their livelihoods. \r\n\r\nFinally, the loss of land not only implies the loss of livelihoods, but also of cultural identity, which is closely tied with the ancestral lands. Displacement from their territories can have significant cultural impacts, including the loss of sacred sites, disruption of traditional practices and detachment to their heritage, which can be deeply felt by indigenous communities and lead to a loss of cultural diversity and erosion of knowledge systems.', 'Due to the impacts that the Tamakoshi-Kathmandu Transmission Line Project has had on indigenous lands and livelihoods, the <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/01/10/power-delivery-from-tamakoshi-to-kathmandu-unlikely-soon?fbclid=IwAR2CYH6l77f31SMuVh9HLCzgPeoyIhz76P8eWL5Iq-R1jOoVdYnlZe1Qhb0\">communities have mobilised themselves</a> and constantly advocated for the protection of their rights. \r\n\r\nA great example is the opposition to the construction of the transmission line and a correspondent substation in Bojheni locality of the Shankarapur Municipality of Kathmandu. The area is inhabited by the Indigenous Tamang, among which around 500 households have been directly affected by the project. They have repeatedly opposed it, and demanded that the substation shouldn’t be built at the proposed location as it affects a human settlement. In 2021, locals submitted a <a href=\"https://cemsoj.wordpress.com/2021/11/04/tamakoshi-kathmandu-transmission-line-affected-communities-call-on-the-asian-development-bank-to-realign-the-power-line-and-relocate-its-sub-station/\">memorandum</a> to the ADB’s Nepal Resident Mision calling for realignment od the Transmission Line and shifting of the substation from their settlement area as planned under the Electricity Transmission Expansion and Supply Improvement Project. They <a href=\"https://iwgia.org/doclink/iwgia-aipp-saman-statement-nepal-sop-state-brutality-against-the-tamang-indigenous-peoples-19-jan-2023-eng/eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJpd2dpYS1haXBwLXNhbWFuLXN0YXRlbWVudC1uZXBhbC1zb3Atc3RhdGUtYnJ1dGFsaXR5LWFnYWluc3QtdGhlLXRhbWFuZy1pbmRpZ2Vub3VzLXBlb3BsZXMtMTktamFuLTIwMjMtZW5nIiwiaWF0IjoxNjc0MTk5MTExLCJleHAiOjE2NzQyODU1MTF9.EHTuhTE9hqWUbLLDMFBpnNir67BYSLsqElrRLWeAurE\">further allegated</a> not having been adequately informed about the impacts of the line, and its construction was being held without authorisation of the locals. They explained that the line devaluates their properties and significantly affects their livelihoods, dependent on agriculture, tourism and environment, and will potentially displace them from their ancestral lands, therefore violating their rights. \r\n\r\nOn January 2023, the NEA forcefully initiated a survey of the land, which created agitation among the local affected communities. The chairperson from the Tamang claimed that the substation was built without the informed consent of the local people, who were “emotionally blackmailed to acquire the land”, and they did not get to participate in decision-making processes regarding the project. Therefore, local communities <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/01/15/lapsephedi-protest-hints-at-challenges-in-expansion-of-transmission-lines\">protested</a> for weeks. During the first week, at least seven people, including women and a minor were arrested, protestors were threatened at gunpoint and the Ward Chair, women and other protestors were manhandled by the police, injuring at least a dozen people. \r\n\r\nConsequently, 85 organisations, lead by SAMAN (Nepal), AIPP (Thailand) and IWGIA (Denmark) signed a joint statement to stop state brutality against the Tamang, which has, naturally, created an atmosphere of fear among the residents. In the statement, the organisations and individuals demand NEA and ADB to halt the forced survey, withdraw police and armed forces and arrange medical treatment for the injuries. Most importantly, they demand compliance with the right to Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) of the addicted IPs to any further process with the project, and with Nepal’s legal obligations, which include the ILO Convention No.169 and UNDRIP, that protect the rights of IPs. \r\n\r\nBy June 2023, the construction of the substation had been obstructed for weeks by the local community, who kept opposing it. Eventually, the NEA invited a group of locals to discuss the matter, and they reached a three-point agreement to ease the situation, discontinuing the obstruction on the condition that the police mobilisation was withdrawn.', 'Under Nepal’s Treaty Act, 2047 (1990), the provisions of a treaty that Nepal has signed are enforceable as national law, and prevail in case of inconsistency with the latter. The country is therefore bound by the provisions of the Convention no. 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP), among other international law instruments. Taking this into account, many rights of the indigenous peoples and affected communities were violated as a result of the project:\r\n\r\nLand rights of Indigenous Peoples (guaranteed by Arts, 13-19 and art. 14.2 ILO): Art. 14.2. ILO establishes the obligation for governments to take the necessary steps to identify the lands which IPs traditionally occupy, and to guarantee effective protection of their rights of ownership and possession. \r\nFree, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC): it is a specific right enshrined in UNDRIP and that aligns to IPs universal rights to self determination. This principle allows them to withhold or withdraw consent regarding projects impacting their territories, and allows them to engage in negotiations, shape, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the projects. It is mentioned in UNDRIP in regards to relocation, dispossession of lands, cultural, religious or spiritual property, cooperation, development and more; and has been violated in several occasions as a result of the project.\r\nRight to not be forcibly removed from one’s land or territory (UNDRIP, art 10): “No relocation shall take place without free, prior and informed consent of the indigenous peoples concerned and after agreement on just and fair compensation and, where possible, with the option of return”. \r\nRight to inclusive and meaningful consultation. The ILO Convention establishes the right to consultation to peoples concerned through appropriate procedures regarding measures that may affect them directly, as well as participation in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly (Arts 6.1.a and 7.1). Furthermore, UNDRIP establishes the right to participate in decision-making in matters which would affect their rights (art. 18), as well as the right to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their rights to development (art. 23). \r\nRight to livelihood and means of sustenance: UNDRIP, in art. 20 establishes the right for IPs to be secure in the enjoyment of their own means of subsistence and development, and to engage freely in all their traditional and other economic activities. Furthermore, when deprived of such means, they are entitled to a just and fair redress. \r\nRight to fair compensation and redress: protected by art. 8.2 UNDRIP, for deprivation of cultural values, dispossession from lands, territories or resources and forced population transfers. \r\nRight to decide regarding their development: art. 7.1. ILO protects the right to decide their priorities for development, allowing them to participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly. \r\nRight not to be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of their culture (art. 8.1 UNDRIP), and to maintain, protect and develop manifestations of their culture (art. 11 UNDRIP), and to maintain, protect and have access to their religious and cultural sites (art. 12 UNDRIP).', 'Bojehini Village, Shankharapur municipality Ward no.3', '$75.25 million', 'Tamang community, around 500 affected households', '2015', 'Nepal Electricity Authority', 'N/A', 'ADB’s Social Monitoring Report, 2022 https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents//41155-013-nep-ieeab.pdf\r\n\r\nABD’s Initial Environmental Examination, 2016 https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents//41155-013-iee-vol1-01.pdf \r\n\r\nThe Kathmandu Post, “Power delivery from Tamakoshi to Kathmandu unlikely soon”, January 2023 https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/01/10/power-delivery-from-tamakoshi-to-kathmandu-unlikely-soon?fbclid=IwAR2CYH6l77f31SMuVh9HLCzgPeoyIhz76P8eWL5Iq-R1jOoVdYnlZe1Qhb0 \r\n\r\nThe Kathmandu Post, “Lapsephedi protest hints at challenges in expansion of transmission lines” January 2023 https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/01/15/lapsephedi-protest-hints-at-challenges-in-expansion-of-transmission-lines Lapsephedi protests\r\n\r\nThe Kathmandu Post, “NEA plans 20 substations in Kathmandu Valley but concerns over land acquisition remain, May 2023 https://kathmandupost.com/valley/2023/05/24/nea-plans-20-substations-in-kathmandu-valley-but-concerns-over-land-acquisition-remain \r\n\r\nSAMAN, AIPP and IWGIA’s Joint Statement “Nepal: Stop State Brutality against the Tamang INdigenous Peoples and Locals”, January 2023 https://iwgia.org/doclink/iwgia-aipp-saman-statement-nepal-sop-state-brutality-against-the-tamang-indigenous-peoples-19-jan-2023-eng/eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJpd2dpYS1haXBwLXNhbWFuLXN0YXRlbWVudC1uZXBhbC1zb3Atc3RhdGUtYnJ1dGFsaXR5LWFnYWluc3QtdGhlLXRh\r\n\r\nCEMSOJ, “Tamakoshi-Kathmandu Transmission Line affected communities call in the Asian Development Bank to realign the power and relocate its substation” November 2021\r\nhttps://cemsoj.wordpress.com/2021/11/04/tamakoshi-kathmandu-transmission-line-affected-communities-call-on-the-asian-development-bank-to-realign-the-power-line-and-relocate-its-sub-station/\r\n\r\nADB’s Project Sheet on T-K Line Project https://www.adb.org/projects/41155-013/main#', '2024-03-11 05:20:29', '2024-03-11 05:20:29'),

The project is therefore located chiefly in Eastern Nepal. Sunuwar Indigenous Peoples, along with Sherpa Indigenous communities and the Bahun and Chhetries have <a href=\"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/hydroelectric-development-violates-human-rights-nepals-likhu-river\">historic cultural ties</a> with the river. The Sunuwar People have a particularly strong attachment to the river, as they use it for the cremation of their deceased, as well as other cultural and healing activities. They also <a href=\"https://www.devkumarsunuwar.com.np/hydropower-projects-on-likhu-river-fail-to-obtain-consent-from-indigenous-communities-in-nepal\">derive a living</a> from the river through fishing. The construction of the Likhu-IV threatens to disrupt this balance between the communities and nature. The hydropower project is being financed by Nabil Bank, Sunrise Bank, Laxmi Bank, Global IME Bank, Nepal SBI Bank, Sanima Bank and Prabhu Bank, whose combined investment will make up 75% of the project. The other 25% will be made up from funding from Triveni Group and Vishal Group. Overall, the total investment amount in the project is around <a href=\"https://nepalnews.com/s/nation/dam-of-likhu-4-hydropower-project-breaks\">$122,200,000</a>.  Overseeing of the project has been carried out by the <a href=\"https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2023/02/1266350?fbclid=IwAR1UinhdX9cViWzi3tYi0bqLywlx7Fm2xkiq662_CXtvNheViwIh2jiTZhs\">MV Dugar Group and Green Venure Ltd</a>, which is indirectly financed by India, and the project will help export energy into India for a price.  However, from the outset, and continuously, the project has been laden with accusations that no FPIC was attained from relevant communities, and that indigenous voices have been repeatedly ignored even as they protest their land being taken from them illegally.', 'Although exact figures are not currently available, we know that the project is having a huge impact on Indigenous communities. It has become apparent through field visits and public dialogues that FPIC has not been obtained by investors for the project, and no compensation has been offered for private lands that have been destroyed and vandalised. According to indigenous complaints, investment companies have used threats and mobilised security forces in the process of illegally building on these private lands. A police post and army camp has been installed within the project grounds, with cooperation from the District Administration Office. At least three Sherpa community members have been taken into police custody for protesting as a result. Reportedly, the local government has manufactured consent to the project by arresting protesters and forcing them to sign consent forms under duress. There has reportedly been displacement from lands owned by generations before them, and destruction of crematorium spots and other sacred sites. Furthermore, the Neng fish, which is native to the river, is important to the Sunuwar community, as it is used for birth and death rituals, as well as sustaining the community\'s livelihoods. The building of the project will direct the fish away from communities, affecting their culture and lives in general.  The rights of Indigenous communities living in the area affected by the Likhu-IV project have, furthermore, been continuously violated, as they have not been included in meaningful consultation, and FPIC has not been obtained, nor compensation granted. Finally, no preliminary consultations have been carried out either impact assessments on the community or environment.', 'The Sunuwar people have made many attempts to have their voices heard, and their rights to their land respected. Many protests have been made and organised, both by visiting sites and refusing to leave their homes when the officials attempted to seize the land. These have been met with threats of criminal charges and imprisonment if they do not sign documents handing their land over to the project. Other ways that the lack of consent given from affected communities has been circumnavigated is that it has simply been ignored. There have been instances where complaints have been written to the Chief District Officer, and the Ward’s Office, with no response or acknowledgement made. Furthermore, according to Buddhi Bahadur, who is a resident at the project, states that project promoters have reached agreements with protesters repeatedly in attempts to stop the protests and continue building. Often, false promises of employment, compensation, healthcare and education facilities are made, which have yet to materialise. Promoters are often absent at facilitated public dialogues, even if they promise to be present. PR officers have been sent on behalf of company leaders, such as Rokat Basnet, who expressed commitment to convey concerns and grievances from the community to the board of directors, yet has since stated that the MV Dugar Group has not given time to hear the complaints that he heard. The MV Dugar group has used local government authorities to incite police violence against protesters. The local government has also reached a 19-point agreement with the MV Dugar group, supposedly on behalf of the locals and Indigenous Peoples, seemingly to advance their concerns. However, reportedly, the local government has been transferred the ‘Corporate Social Responsibility’ budget from the MV Dugar group, without any public acknowledgement of how these funds would be spent. To this day, affected communities have not received compensation, and the local government has stayed silent on the issue. Not only this, but, according to the ward chairperson of Umakunda-3, Kubu-Kasthali Ramesh Kumar Sunuwar, the budget provided under CSR has just been used to contribute to the building of Likhu-4 and the roads surrounding it.  Furthemore, following the agreement, the MV Dugar group expressed a commitment to the ILO Convention 169 and its provisions, yet no steps have been taken to realise them in this context. There have been three public hearings, overwhelmingly attended to by community members, and covered by indigenous radio and television stations to try and generate awareness.

Initially, the project was financed by the Asian Development Bank, the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation, the United Nations Development Program, and the Finish Development Agency.', 'The KGHP is a run of the river project that began in 1997. Initially, the project was financed by the Asian Development Bank, the Japanese Bank for International Cooperation, the United Nations Development Program, and the Finish Development Agency. This massive construction, worth an estimated <a href=\"https://ejatlas.org/print/kali-gandaki-hydroelectric-project-a-nepal\">$420million</a> at the time of construction, was carried out by the NEA, alongside Impregilo S.p.a. Due to the timing of the project, Nepal was not part of any international treaty concerning indigenous rights, such as the ILO, however there were Nepalese <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/Y3994E/y3994e0y.htm\">regulations</a> that required an Environmental Impact Assessment.   The area in question where this project was located is along the Kali Gandakhi river, with the Dam being located below the Kali Gandhaki and Andhi Khloa rivers. The project is present in the Syangia, Gulmi, Palpa and Parbat districts. The main facility area was <a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/559221468058761696/pdf/IPP6180v10P1320IC0disclosed02050130.pdf\">home</a> to Brahmin, Magar, Newar and Sunar communities, whilst along the transmission lines and substation areas, there were Chhetri, Magar, Newar, Bote and Dalit communities.  According to the <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/Y3994E/y3994e0y.htm\">EIA</a>, the livelihoods of many within these communities depended on the fishing of native species such as snowtrout and mahseer fish. Due to lack of financial and social support, building came to a halt in the early 2000s, however, the World Bank further funded the project in 2017, to fix issues for example sedimentary buildup, and improve the project status so that it was fit to run effectively, loaning funds of <a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/682981515169371264/pdf/Implementation-Completion-and-Results-Report-ICR-Document-P132289-2017-12-28-10-31-002-01022018.pdf\">$4,852,394</a>.  the project has therefore been ongoing for nearly two decades, and whilst there have been signs of FPIC and compensation for indigenous groups, there are indications that those communities have also been disadvantaged throughout the construction of the project.', 'The Kali Gandaki River is considered to be one of the most sacred in Nepal, as such, many communities have many ceremonial and cultural ties to the river, for example using it to embalm their dead. Furthermore, many communities, in particular, the Bote community, have historically relied on the river and its natural functioning for their livelihoods. The lack of access to the river, and the rerouting of some parts of the river has meant that they have lost their <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/65242402/Advantages_of_hydro_generation_Resettlement_of_Indigenous_Bote_Fisherman_families_A_Case_Study_of_Kali_Gandaki_A_Hydroelectric_Project_of_Nepal\">traditional occupations</a>. 12 villages have been <a href=\"https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/evaluation-document/35901/files/in13-13.pdf\">directly affected</a> by the project, encompassing 1,468 families, 17 of which were Bote families, and 2 of which were Magar families.  These families have experienced land loss, displacement, reduction in ownership of assets, degrading professions and loss of income. Furthermore, <a href=\"https://nepalnews.com/s/nation/gandaki-province-warns-of-protest-in-continual-of-kaligandaki-project\">arguments have been made</a> suggesting that the impacts of the project could be felt outside the boundaries of the project ground itself, and that downstream sites such as Chitwan National Park may also be negatively impacted from the water diversion. There is <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/65242402/Advantages_of_hydro_generation_Resettlement_of_Indigenous_Bote_Fisherman_families_A_Case_Study_of_Kali_Gandaki_A_Hydroelectric_Project_of_Nepal\">much evidence</a> to at least indicate that residents affected by the project were granted a higher rate of compensation than average communities affected by NEA projects in Nepal.  However, out of a sample survey conducted by the World Bank, there is <a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/559221468058761696/pdf/IPP6180v10P1320IC0disclosed02050130.pdf\">evidence</a> to suggest that not all compensation was adequately provided, with only half of the sample indicating satisfaction with the project implementation, and 20/126 surveyed households stated that they did not receive compensation.  Furthermore, of the families that did receive compensation, concerns have been raised that with the loss of livelihoods the money will not be enough to help them integrate into a wider capitalist society. Due to the timing of the initial project, the concept of FPIC was not widely circulated, and so there is little to indicate whether it was obtained, and whether public consultation was carried out. However, there is much evidence that indicates that relocation efforts were carried out (though some communities were relocated to unsatisfactory or unsafe locations), as well as the installation of medical centers, clean water, and schools, and finally, employment efforts for the communities affected were also put in place. This indicates burden sharing and consultation. With the proposals to fix and update the project put forward in 2013, a full impact assessment was carried out, and according to the World Bank Report, a PCPD program was developed and implemented.', 'There have been noted protests and objections made to both the initial building of the project and the amendment project in 2013. There aren’t many articles indicating protests or advocacies undertaken during the initial project. This may be because of the weaker legal remedies available at the time, however we do know that there were onsite <a href=\"https://ejatlas.org/print/kali-gandaki-hydroelectric-project-a-nepal\">retaliatory protests</a>. We know that there was compensation given, and relocation efforts made, and that the building continued. However, the World Bank reports from 2013 show the results of public consultation, whereby concerns or failings of the initial project were raised regarding issues such as water not being accessible for festive days, not enough land being transferred to Bote families, and ineffective siren warning systems. The Project was developed with a further community support program to address these issues. This isn’t to say that further protests weren’t carried out with the renovations of the project- the Gandai Chief Minister Krishna Chandra Nepali warned that the diversion plan could not be allowed to succeed, stating that there would be protests is the federal government did not listen to their demands. The Gandaki province called an all-party meeting to form a common view on the project with the government. Furthermore, Prakash Mani Sharma and others filed a <a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-scs-stay-order\">writ petition</a> with the Supreme Court, who issued an interim order against carrying out any activity on the river until further decisions were reached.However, in <a href=\"https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/26719\">2023</a>, resumption of construction began.', 'ILO Convention No. 169 (Ratified by Nepal 2007)\r\nArt 14 (1) mandates recognition of Indigenous Peoples “rights of ownership and possession” over the lands they “traditionally occupy.” This includes “lands not exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and traditional activities.”\r\nUN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People\r\nA 23 affirms the right of indigenous peoples “to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their right to development.”\r\nA28(2) states that  “unless otherwise freely agreed upon by the peoples concerned, compensation shall take the form of lands, territories and resources equal in quality, size and legal status or of monetary compensation or other appropriate redress.”\r\nLand Acquisition Act 1977\r\nA7- (1) Compensation shall be paid for losses resulting from clearing of crops and trees, and of demolition of walls, etc., or for damage, if any, suffered as a result of the removal or digging of earth, stone, ditches, or boring', 'Kali Gandhaki River', '$420 million, Amendment project $4,852,394', 'Brahmin, Magar, Newar, Sunar, Chhetri and Bota', '1997', 'The Nepali Supreme Court', 'N/A', '<a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/opinion/editorial-scs-stay-order\" target=\"_blank\">The Himalayan Times Report</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/26719\" target=\"_blank\">Rising Nepal Daily Report</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://ejatlas.org/print/kali-gandaki-hydroelectric-project-a-nepal\" target=\"_blank\">EJ Atlas report</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/Y3994E/y3994e0y.htm\" target=\"_blank\">FAO report</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/559221468058761696/pdf/IPP6180v10P1320IC0disclosed02050130.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">NEA Project Report</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/682981515169371264/pdf/Implementation-Completion-and-Results-Report-ICR-Document-P132289-2017-12-28-10-31-002-01022018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">World Bank Report</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/65242402/Advantages_of_hydro_generation_Resettlement_of_Indigenous_Bote_Fisherman_families_A_Case_Study_of_Kali_Gandaki_A_Hydroelectric_Project_of_Nepal\" target=\"_blank\">Rajendra P.

It crosses the border between India and Nepal,  with a capacity of up to 1000 MW, between the two states.  It connects to the existing 132 kV transmission line at Arun Khola.', 'This case concerns the construction of the transmission line between Hetauda-Bharatpur and Bharatpur-Bardaghat. It crosses the border between India and Nepal, in order to <a href=\"https://www.lahurnip.org/world-bank-financed-220-kv-transmission-line-project\">facilitate electricity trade</a> with a capacity of up to 1000 MW, between the two states.  It connects to the existing 132 kV transmission line at Arun Khola. The primary area of concern is the human settlement of Binayi Tribeni Rural Municipality of Nawalparasi district, Gandaki province. The overall budget for the project is approximately <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/money/2019/10/15/electricity-authority-looking-for-new-contractor-to-build-transmission-line\">$182 million</a>, $99 million of this being a concessional loan from the World Bank’s International Development Association, and the rest of the funding coming from the Nepalese government.  The construction of the final two towers of the transmission line was halted due to an interim order of the Supreme Court, following a writ petition filed by locals. The affected communities, with the help of LAHURNIP, <a href=\"https://risingnepaldaily.com/news/13228#:~:text=The%20Bharatpur-Bardaghat%20132%20kV%20transmission%20line%20is%20separated,the%20old%20132%20KV%20line%20to%20Bardaghat%20substation\">filed legal litigation</a> stating their objection to the change in plans for the towers’ location, and the impact it would have on indigenous communities, who had not been properly consulted by the Nepal Electricity Authority.  They demanded that the route be changed back to the original plans, which would not disrupt the population dense areas that the new plans aimed to build on. The building recommenced in June 2022, when the Supreme Court rejected the writ petition. However, the <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/accountability/brief/world-bank-first-dispute-resolution-service-outcome\">World Bank</a> held mediation meetings, and eventually an agreement was reached between parties, although the terms have been kept private.', 'Indigenous communities such as the Magar, Gurung and Tamang communities werwe amongst those negatively affected by the changes to the proposals for the Bharatpur-Bardaghat transmission line. According to the complaint (request for inspection) form submitted to the World Bank, the changes made to the route were done so without community members’ consent and public notification. The building of towers in these areas pose the risk of, and have effected negative impacts such as physical harm, as the transmission line passes directly through the community, and in some cases is not 5 metres away from residential homes. This increases the risk posed to the safety of the communities, and their access to public lands, sacred sites, schools etc. (three schools fall within 500 m of the transmission line). They have also had the effect of harming the biodiversity of the area, causing environmental degradation to the flora and fauna around where the towers are scheduled to be built. It is likely to cause mass displacement of communities, as they avoid the adverse impacts of the transmission line construction. Furthermore, the right to housing, and building houses on land that has traditionally belonged to indigenous communities, is in jeopardy, as building on land that has transmission lines and towers on it will non longer be viable for domestic construction in the future. All of these risks create a general risk to the livelihoods of these communities, in terms of their agricultural practices and economies affiliated with farming, that may be removed from indigenous people and their communities should the construction go ahead. Another alarming issue raised was the fact that the mandatory requirements for free prior and informed consent were not fulfilled when the locations for the towers were changed. Information regarding the project was not disseminated, meetings were not held with the affected communities, and documents were forged. Land acquisition notices were never published, and only were presented amid COVID-19, whilst a <a href=\"https://www.inspectionpanel.org/sites/default/files/cases/documents/154-Request%20for%20Inspection-Redacted-18%20October%202021.pdf\">stay order</a> from the Supreme Court was in place.', 'The affected communities appealed to the Village Development Committee to send a letter on their behalf to the Ministry of Energy to ask them to reconsider the original, less invasive route. The letter stated that the new route had adverse impacts on 96 households’, their land, agriculture, income, with increased health risks, potential displacement, and human rights violations. The VDC sent the letter to the MoE, asking them to consider building along the northeast of the Mijing River, along a route that avoided human settlement. These requests were ignored, and building went ahead without the procurement of consent, and with the use of security forces being used to suppress protests. Though there was a public hearing carried out in Kawasori, the affected community was absent due to lack of prior public notification, and the fact that the hearing took place in a different municipality to the one primarily at risk. The police forces deployed in reaction to peaceful protests against the building work have used tear gas and physical force, injuring women, senior citizens, and children. Finally, a writ petition was filed with the Supreme Court on the 6th March 2021, and building was delayed as a result, whilst the Supreme Court decided the case.  49 members of the community of Dumkibas, filed a complaint to the World Bank’s Dispute Resolution Service on 18th October 2021. They requested for the WB to address the adverse impacts they would experience through the construction of the transmission line through their community, by helping them engage in conversation and discord with the NEA.  The Supreme Court eventually ruled that building could proceed on 26th June 2022, after dismissing the writ petition, however, due to obstructions created by local dissent, building still did not commence for another year. Following the NEA’s decision to offer compensation for up to 50% of the value of the land lost to the project, this local objection has ceased, and building has resumed. However, despite the NEA’s more flexible approach to negotiations and compensation, locals are losing out on land that they still are not being properly compensated for. For example, those who have lost 75% of their land will only be compensated for 50%, those who have lost between 25% and 50% of their land will be eligible for 30% of the land\'s value as <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/06/13/stalled-bharatpur-bardaghat-transmission-line-work-finally-resumes\">compensation</a>, etc.  The <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/07/11/hetauda-bharatpur-power-line-comes-into-operation\">project</a> is estimated to conclude in mid-august', 'ILO Convention No. 169 (Ratified by Nepal 2007)\r\n Art 7(1) affirms the rights of Indigenous Peoples “to decide their own priorities for the process of development” and to “participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly”\r\nArt 14 (1) mandates recognition of Indigenous Peoples “rights of ownership and possession” over the lands they “traditionally occupy.” This includes “lands not exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and traditional activities.”\r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\r\nA26- asserts the right of Indigenous Peoples to ‘the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired’\r\nA 23 affirms the right of indigenous peoples “to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their right to development.”\r\nA32 states that ‘States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly in connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other resources’\r\nA 28(1) states that “indigenous peoples have the right to redress, by means that can include restitution or, when this is not possible, just, fair and equitable compensation, for the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used, and which have been confiscated, taken, occupied, used or damaged without their free, prior and informed consent.”\r\nA28(2) states that  “unless otherwise freely agreed upon by the peoples concerned, compensation shall take the form of lands, territories and resources equal in quality, size and legal status or of monetary compensation or other appropriate redress.”\r\nUN Declaration on the Right to Development \r\nA1(1) defines the right to development an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development\r\nThe Constitution of Nepal\r\nA51(b)(1) requires the Nepalese Government to ‘implement international treaties, agreements to which Nepal is a party’\r\nA51(j)(8)- states the necessity to ‘make the indigenous nationalities (Aadibasi Janajati) participate in decisions concerning that community by making special provisions for opportunities and benefits in order to ensure the right of these nationalities to live with dignity, along with their identity, and protect and promote traditional knowledge, skill, culture, social tradition and experience of the indigenous nationalities and local communities’\r\nLand Acquisition Act 1977\r\nA6 Preliminary action relating to Acquire Land: \r\n(1) The officer initiating preliminary Action pursuant to Section 5 shall put a copy of notice in following office or place for the purpose of stakeholder, (a) A place where people mostly move near by the concerned land, (b) Concerned Village Development Committee and Municipality Office, (c) House door or compound wall, if house and compound wall has to be acquired.\r\n(2) The officer initiating preliminary action may enter into the concerned land or house a compound along with employee and workers for the purpose of following works after three days of Notification pursuant to Subsection (1).

Construction has been ongoing since 2003, however there were delays to the building process due to local dissent and protests, deferring the <a href=\"https://hpl.com.np/inauguration-of-khimti-dhalkebar-220kv-transmission-line/\">deadline</a> from 2009- 2017. The projects estimated cost is <a href=\"https://www.nea.org.np/admin/assets/uploads/supportive_docs/VCDPFinal.pdf\">$22 million</a>, with funding for the project being granted by the NEA, HMGN and the World Bank  The World Bank contributed $75 million to the project, however concerns were quickly raised regarding the violations of national and international laws, and operational policies of the World Bank itself. Chiefly, these violations centred around the lack of FPIC from indigenous communities, and the forced displacement and lack of benefit sharing that was also occurring as a <a href=\"https://www.lahurnip.org/world-bank-financed-220-kv-khimti-dhalkeber-transmission-line-project\">direct result of the construction</a>. The main communities directly and negatively affected by the project were Tamang, Megar and Newar communities, who traditionally occupied and owned the land upon which the power line was planned to be built. Throughout the construction of the project, <a href=\"https://rightsindevelopment.org/our-work/hrd/in-nepal-fighting-for-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples/\">concerns have also been raised</a> regarding brutal and extrajudicial force used by police against peaceful protesters in order to forcibly remove them from sites in order to build upon them.', 'It is estimated that <a href=\"https://www.accountabilitycounsel.org/client-case/nepal-high-voltage-transmission-line/#:~:text=The%20Khimti%2DDhalkebar%20220%20kV%20Transmission%20Line%20is%20a%20high,Power%20Development%20Project%20(NPDP)\">114 \'000</a> people have been negatively impacted by the construction of the Khimti-Dhalkebar transmission line.  These impacts include loss of residential and urban areas to the construction sites, loss of schools, potential health and safety risks, lack of consultation or information, environmental impacts, inadequate compensation, police violence and coercion. At the project\'s initial proposal stage, the World  Bank relied on outdated data collected from a 2006 census, therefore the full extent of the impact on individuals  and communities was not appreciated. This led to <a href=\"https://www.icij.org/inside-icij/2015/07/world-bank-overlooked-families-nepal-project-panel-finds/\">unaccounted villagers losing their land</a>, with some being denied any compensation at all.   Peaceful protests were held in an attempt to persuade project enforcers to reroute the transmission line, however, in 2012, an armed police response was deployed to the site of a protest, and in the process of dismantling the protest, beat women so hard the injuries are still affecting them to this day. Similarly, in April and July 2016, armed police retaliation to a peaceful protest in the Sindhuli District resulted in the detention and beating of protesters. Both times, <a href=\"https://www.accountabilitycounsel.org/client-case/nepal-high-voltage-transmission-line/#:~:text=The%20Khimti%2DDhalkebar%20220%20kV%20Transmission%20Line%20is%20a%20high,Power%20Development%20Project%20(NPDP)\">community members were forced to sign forms</a> granting their ‘consent’ to the project before being released.', 'Attempts at advocacy have taken multiple forms. In November 2012, a peaceful protest was held, however, the police response was violent, and caused permanent damage to at least 10 protesting women. Threats of violence and intimidation from the NEA have been prevalent throughout the project building, with further police violence being utilised against a peaceful sit-in outside government offices on 10th April 2016. Direct communication from the NEA of the World Bank to the relevant communities has been sparse, often with meetings between representatives and community leaders ending with relevant concerns being dismissed. The World Bank released the project documents, which revealed that outdated data had been relied upon in the project’s conception. In January 2013, a writ petition was filed to the Supreme Court of Nepal, requesting an interim halt order against the project, and in February of the same year, a letter of concern was sent from affected communities to the World Bank, resulting in a meeting in March 2013. The government of Nepal responded to these attempts at peaceful advocacy by sending armed police forces to the construction site in order to force a resumption of the project. A second writ petition was filed to the Supreme Court in April 2013 by LAHURNIP, requesting that the land acquisition by the NEA for the road projects associated with the Transmission line be prevented. The following July, LAHURNIP and the Accountability Counsel assisted relevant communities in filing a complaint to the Inspection Panel, requesting a report be made regarding the eligibility of the project, which was issued in November of that year. The Accountability Counsel, acting on behalf of the affected community, advocated with the Inspection Panel against the World Bank, to ensure continued engagement. For example, in April 2015, the AC produced the report Livelihoods on the Line, and met with World Bank Board Members to discuss the report and further encourage a response. In July 2015, the World Bank released a report and action plan, indicating an intention to mediate with the relevant parties to reach a more beneficial agreement, through following proper process and acquiring FPIC. Throughout these advocacy attempts, threats of violence were still being made against relevant indigenous communities, therefore in July 2016, a letter and briefing paper was sent to the World Bank urging them to counter the project’s militarization. In August 2016, a letter was sent from community members to the World Bank President and Board, requesting that misrepresentations in their action plan and report be rectified. In March 2017, a facilitator was hired to oversee dialogues between the Government of Nepal and residents of Sidhuli, and in 2017 requests and appeals were made to the World Bank for an expert impartial report about conflict resolution in Nepal’s energy sector. The appeals boards demanded the release of the report by the Consensus Building Institute in October 2018. The transmission line came into operation in 2017,  despite issues raised by communities remaining unresolved, largely due to the fact that the World Bank stopped funding mediation meetings without any explanation.. However, compensation was afforded to indigenous communities.', 'ILO Convention No. 169 (Ratified by Nepal 2007)\r\n Art 7(1) affirms the rights of Indigenous Peoples “to decide their own priorities for the process of development” and to “participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly”\r\nArt 14 (1) mandates recognition of Indigenous Peoples “rights of ownership and possession” over the lands they “traditionally occupy.” This includes “lands not exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and traditional activities.”\r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\r\nA26- asserts the right of Indigenous Peoples to ‘the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired’\r\nA 23 affirms the right of indigenous peoples “to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their right to development.”\r\nA32 tates that ‘States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly in connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other resources’\r\nA 28(1) states that “indigenous peoples have the right to redress, by means that can include restitution or, when this is not possible, just, fair and equitable compensation, for the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used, and which have been confiscated, taken, occupied, used or damaged without their free, prior and informed consent.”\r\nA28(2) states that t “unless otherwise freely agreed upon by the peoples concerned, compensation shall take the form of lands, territories and resources equal in quality, size and legal status or of monetary compensation or other appropriate redress.”\r\nUN Declaration on the Right to Development \r\nA1(1) defines the right to development an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development\r\nThe Constitution of Nepal\r\nA51(b)(1) requires the Nepalese Government to ‘implement international treaties, agreements to which Nepal is a party’\r\nA51(j)(8)- states the necessity to ‘make the indigenous nationalities (Aadibasi Janajati) participate in decisions concerning that community by making special provisions for opportunities and benefits in order to ensure the right of these nationalities to live with dignity, along with their identity, and protect and promote traditional knowledge, skill, culture, social tradition and experience of the indigenous nationalities and local communities’   \r\n\r\nLand Acquisition Act 1977\r\n\r\nA8.

However, economic displacement impacts could be severe, if not physical, as the <a href=\"https://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAH814.pdf\">livelihoods</a> within the proposed project area are predominantly based on agriculture, and access to cardamom and medicinal plants that grow along the river.

However, the project was restarted in February 2020, resulting from an agreement between Nepal and India signed in 2008.  The estimated cost of the project, through its most recent MoA, is $1.6 billion, and is being developed on a build-own-operate and transfer basis, between Arun 3 Power Development (SAPDC)- a subsidiary of Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam, and the Government of Nepal. <a href=\"https://www.power-technology.com/projects/arun-iii-hydropower-project/\">Other financers of the project</a> are Everest Bank, Nabil Bank, State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, Union Bank of India and Export-Import Bank of India.

This is because concerns have been continuously raised around the fact that this project has been initiated without consultation of valid concerns raised by locals. The opposition to the initial plan came at a time when the concept of hydropower projects in Nepal, particularly those introduced with international funding, was relatively new. Therefore, miscommunications and distrust were rife, with people worried that the promise of new infrastructure and roads were not painting a full picture of the repercussions such a huge project would have on locals and their way of life. Though there was <a href=\"https://nepalstudycenter.unm.edu/MissPdfFiles/The%20Loss%20of%20Arun%20IIIRevised.pdf\">some support from locals</a> at the beginning, this was arguably because of a lack of understanding of the toll that the project would take on local ways of life and traditions.  This was not helped by the fact that by 1993, the only impact reports, prepared by the King Mahendra Trust, were difficult to locate and pay for, and were exclusively written in English. This is a clear violation of the locals right to give informed consent. Furthermore, by the time that <a href=\"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/defining-local-arun-controversy-villagers-ngos-and-world\">local consultation was held</a>, the project had already begun.   Huge issue was taken with the fact that the World bank <a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/default/files/publication/2012/12/destruction-dawnfinalnovember2012.pdf\">assessment standards</a>, both on environmental and local impact, were not adhered to, and alternatives were not properly considered.   Alarmingly, though the World Bank pulled funding from the project, the MoU between India and Nepal signed in the resurrection of the project did not initially address any of the World Banks findings of issues and abuses associated with the project. Many of the individuals who live on the land rely on farming the land that they own and have owned for centuries. This land will be <a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/default/files/publication/2012/12/destruction-dawnfinalnovember2012.pdf\">submerged in the construction of the dam</a>, and the rest will be at significantly higher risks of flooding and further damage and submersion.  In fact, the risk of landslides and related natural disasters is expected to increase in Nepal, according to <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020/climate-change-could-trigger-more-landslides-in-high-mountain-asia\">reports</a>.  There have been instances of land being damages in the process of the dam’s construction, with no explanation other than the activity was authorized by the state. In many of these instances, specific consent of landowners was not sought preemptively. Furthermore, the locals, particularly local women, rely on the surrounding forestry in their day to day lives. Complaints have been raised regarding the impact the project will have on the forest, and therefore, on the indigenous communities that use them in their traditions and lifestyles, such as the cultivation and harvesting of cardamom, which helps generate cash income. Finally, the locals rely on the river itself as a resource, both for fishing and for religious practice associated to the river. About 40% of locals use the river for fishing, and rely upon it for seasonal income. The river is <a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/default/files/publication/2012/12/destruction-dawnfinalnovember2012.pdf\">integral</a> to ritual practices within the communities, both on an individual and group level.  A large scale dam would throw all of these traditions and practices into the balance, which makes the dismissal of smaller, less impactful projects all the more alarming. Whilst project reports have been completed to a more satisfactory standard for the renewal of the project, the <a href=\" https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/09/17/after-27-years-world-bank-returns-to-arun-river\">report made by the NEA</a> fixes compensation for 22 displaced households, and the use or damage to 2025 hectares of land.   Arguably, this does not accurately compensate all victims to the project to the full extent, as <a href=\"https://www.nea.org.np/admin/assets/uploads/supportive_docs/71601820.pdf\">studies</a> indicate that 335 households will experience loss or displacement as a result of the construction of the dam.  The compensation offered seems to have been based off the land value and not for the changes to livelihoods or other associated costs of the project that may be incurred. Furthermore, it is <a href=\"http://southasiacheck.org/in-public-interest/the-uprooted/\">reported</a> that no land for land option has been offered to those who have been displaced, instead the government, bizarrely, have promised that that will occur later on.', 'The withdrawal of the World Bank’s funding was largely brought about through local protest. The President of the World Bank at the time maintained that the decision was based on a reassessment of the problem, however, he stated that the role of the Arun Concerned Group and the Alliance for Energy was pertinent to bringing new information to the World Bank and influencing the decision.  The local protest was held on an international level, and as a result, the initial project was brought to a halt due to the fact that preliminary reporting did not align with the World Bank’s internal policies and standards.  \r\nThough, some 20 plus years later, the project seems to have had an improvement in the quality of preliminary reports surrounding its viability, there is still local dissent surrounding the way in which information has been gathered, and the lack of payout that was promised by the government. There have been protests against the project led and held by locals and indigenous communities in order to force financiers and the Nepalese government to meet local’s demands. For example, in 2008, the Indigenous Peoples Rights Forum stated that building work would be halted by protest until assurances were made by the Nepalese Government and Sutlej Corporation that their demands would be met. At the time, no such assurances had been made, however, Project Manager at the time Devandra Wardera stated that, at the time, the project was still in its survey phase, and the demands of locals would be addressed and met upon completion of the project.  However, this has not been the end of locals resorting to protests in order to have their needs acknowledged. In 2019, struggle committee president spoke at an Investment Board interaction at the District Administration Office demanding that the reality of the land use by the project be reflected properly in the compensation offered. He stated that, whilst locals were not against Arun III, they would launch a protest if the communities continued to be fed empty promises.  As a result, a five member committee was assembled to address the issue. However, in 2021, a protest was launched due to continued ineffective remedy being found to address local needs and compensation rights. Furthermore, protests have continued as recently as September 2023 against the project. Again, this is surrounding the issue of lack of proper compensation, due to a lack of funds being provided, despite promises, by the Nepali Government. A pattern has emerged of protesters being appeased with false promises and empty gestures indicating that they will be properly compensated, only for their needs to be ignored once building and construction of the project recommences.', 'ILO Convention No. 169 (Ratified by Nepal 2007)\r\n•         Art 7(1) affirms the rights of Indigenous Peoples “to decide their own priorities for the process of development” and to “participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly”\r\n•        Art 14 (1) mandates recognition of Indigenous Peoples “rights of ownership and possession” over the lands they “traditionally occupy.” This includes “lands not exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and traditional activities.”\r\nUN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People\r\n•        A 23 affirms the right of indigenous peoples “to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their right to development.”\r\n•        A32 states that ‘States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly in connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other resources’\r\n•        A 28(1) states that “indigenous peoples have the right to redress, by means that can include restitution or, when this is not possible, just, fair and equitable compensation, for the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used, and which have been confiscated, taken, occupied, used or damaged without their free, prior and informed consent.”\r\n•        A28(2) states that  “unless otherwise freely agreed upon by the peoples concerned, compensation shall take the form of lands, territories and resources equal in quality, size and legal status or of monetary compensation or other appropriate redress.”\r\nUN Declaration on the Right to Development \r\n•        A1(1) defines the right to development an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development\r\nThe Constitution of Nepal\r\n•        A51(b)(1) requires the Nepalese Government to ‘implement international treaties, agreements to which Nepal is a party’\r\n•        A51(j)(8)- states the necessity to ‘make the indigenous nationalities (Aadibasi Janajati) participate in decisions concerning that community by making special provisions for opportunities and benefits in order to ensure the right of these nationalities to live with dignity, along with their identity, and protect and promote traditional knowledge, skill, culture, social tradition and experience of the indigenous nationalities and local communities’\r\nLand Acquisition Act 1977\r\n•        A7- (1) Compensation shall be paid for losses resulting from clearing of crops and trees, and of demolition of walls, etc., or for damage, if any, suffered as a result of the removal or digging of earth, stone, ditches, or boring. \r\n•        (3) In case the concerned person is not satisfied with the amount of compensation determined under Sub-Section (2), he/she may file a complaint with the chief District Officer on which he/she receives information thereof, and in such cases the decision of the Chief District Officer shall be final.', 'Sankhuwasabha', '$1.6 billion', 'Diding, Num, Sitalpati and Yaphu communities', '1991', 'Nepal Electricity Authority, The Government of Nepal', 'Arun Concerned Group, Alliance for Energy', '<a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/how-nepal-lost-arun-iii/\" target=\"_blank\">My Republica: How Nepal lost Arun III</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/defining-local-arun-controversy-villagers-ngos-and-world\" target=\"_blank\">Cultural Survival: Defining the “Local” in the Arun Controversy: Villagers, NGOs, and the World Bank in the Arun Valley, Nepal</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.power-technology.com/projects/arun-iii-hydropower-project/\" target=\"_blank\">Power Technology: Arun III Hydropower Project</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/default/files/publication/2012/12/destruction-dawnfinalnovember2012.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Forest Peoples Programme: Destruction at Dawn: The Rights of Indigenous Peoples in the Republic of Nepal</a><br>\r\n<a href=\"https://nepalstudycenter.unm.edu/MissPdfFiles/The%20Loss%20of%20Arun%20IIIRevised.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Nepal Study Centre: The Loss of Arun III, Dr Ram S.

The transmission line is 288.km long, and <a href=\"https://www.nea.org.np/admin/assets/uploads/supportive_docs/47580641.pdf\">initial plans</a> made allowances for the construction of 792 towers.  At the <a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/business/construction-of-transmission-line-stalled-for-six-years\">project’s conception</a> in 2011, the transmission line was presented as essential for strengthening Nepal’s domestic power transmission system.  The transmission line was due to travel across Nepal, from the Hetauda Sub-metropolis-11 substation of Makwanpur and connect to Bhokraha Narasimha Rural Municipality-4 of Sunsari and will cross 10 districts. Whilst the project was intended to help meet the increasing power demand in Nepal, <a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-clears-obstruction-to-transmission-lines\">delays</a> in building have led to complaints from western regions of Nepal to complain that the project has unevenly distributed these energy imports.  On the other side of this argument, however, are arguments from various communities and environmental reports, which indicate that not enough care was taken to plan the least invasive route for the transmission line. Indeed, <a href=\"https://www.urjakhabar.com/news/0603528274\">project reports</a> indicate that 50 different ethnic groups, including Bramhin, Chhetri, Tharu, and Tamang indigenous groups stand to be affected by project activity, who have therefore repeatedly demanded that the transmission line be rerouted.  Though the World Bank had initially pledged $138 million for the project, the ongoing nature of this conflict led to them withdrawing funding from the project, estimated to cost a total of $170 million. The rest of the project will be funded in its entirety by the <a href=\"https://powerline.net.in/2022/07/15/nepal-supreme-court-allows-construction-of-400-kv-hetauda-dhalkebar-inaruwa-project/\">Government of Nepal</a>', 'The project was due to be completed in 2016, however construction is still ongoing, due to <a href=\"http://www.nepalenergyforum.com/power-line-project-floundering-eight-years-into-construction/\">environmental and community impacts</a>, and poor work execution.   According to <a href=\"http://www.nepalenergyforum.com/power-line-project-floundering-eight-years-into-construction/\">initial studies</a>, 564 households were estimated to be at risk of negative impacts due to project construction, with 319 of the proposed towers intended to be built on community forest areas, and 473 on private land.  In order for such <a href=\"https://www.nea.org.np/admin/assets/uploads/supportive_docs/47580641.pdf\">construction to be feasible</a>, 131’229 trees needed to be cut down to create a path for the transmission lines, totaling 95 different species.  The plans for many of these towers were to be built in Chitwan National Park, however <a href=\"https://nepalnews.com/index.php/s/business/transmission-line-of-mcc-grants-land-acquisition-and-access-to-forests-can-be-complicated\">local protests</a> have delayed this construction.  <a href=\" https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/138811629730936524/pdf/Nepal-India-Electricity-Transmission-and-Trade-Project-Resettlement-Action-Plan.pdf\">Resettlement action plans</a> have been formulated by the World Bank, which identifies and acknowledges the amount of project affected locals.  However, what is concerning is that these documents only identify 171 houses that will be affected by the Right of Way. Furthermore, the <a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/138811629730936524/pdf/Nepal-India-Electricity-Transmission-and-Trade-Project-Resettlement-Action-Plan.pdf\">compensation</a> offered to project affected locals covers 20% of the total value of the land affected.  Not only this, but the valuation of the compensation was based off land prices at the time of the project’s conception. Due to local protests, as well as contractor issues and incompetency, delays in building have occurred alongside a huge increase in land prices. This has yet to be reflected in the compensation offered to <a href=\"https://www.urjakhabar.com/news/0603528274\">locals</a>.  Finally, the project is being carried out despite continued <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/118287/\">protests</a> from locals.  Therefore, the lack of FPIC obtained is clear, as the project is being carried out despite lack of agreement from project affected locals.', 'The protests from locals have been a definitive element of the construction of this project. Physical disruption of the project has been one of the delaying factors of its construction. This <a href=\"https://www.urjakhabar.com/news/0603528274\">obstruction</a> prevented the construction of 40-42 towers in various locations and took so long that previously cleared forests grew back.  The project manager of the Transmission Line has responded by continuing to pursue <a href=\"http://www.nepalenergyforum.com/power-line-project-floundering-eight-years-into-construction/\">forest clearance permits</a>.   Furthermore, though some concession has been made towards negotiating with locals regarding compensation, locals are still making it clear that they want the <a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/118287/\">transmission lines to be rerouted</a>, and for other feasible routes to be explored rather than their lands be built on and their traditions and livelihoods be impacted.  As a result of this impasse, and a lack of cooperation from the NEA and other contractors, writ petitions have been filed with the Nepal Supreme Court, by former minister Sarita Giri, on 30th January 2020, requesting that the building be stopped and rerouted. The interim order was issued accordingly, however <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/07/06/court-paves-the-way-for-the-construction-of-pylons-in-hetauda-dhalkebar-inaruwa-power-line\">follow up hearings were delayed for three years</a>, partially due to the inefficiency of the Supreme Court generally, and partially due to the impacts of Covid-19.  However, the Supreme Court gave its verdict in 2023, stating that building could continue, and that the NEA only needed to grant compensation to the locals as per the compensation guidelines. The Supreme Court stated that the importance of supplying energy to Western Nepal was a <a href=\"https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/sc-clears-obstruction-to-transmission-lines\">key consideration</a> in the decision.  Whilst this is a disappointing outcome, it is relevant to consider that the World Bank, who was funding the project, has stopped the funding and soft management of the project due to the delays that have occurred due to protests, inefficient contractors, and other factors. The World Bank had extended the project deadline several times, however, due to continuous delays due to protests from locals, the <a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2022/07/06/court-paves-the-way-for-the-construction-of-pylons-in-hetauda-dhalkebar-inaruwa-power-line\">funding was discontinued</a>.

Specifically, it will run from Lapsiphedi, in Northeastern Kathmandu, to Ratmate in Nuwakot.  This project is part of a wider scheme funded by the US aid Millenium Challenge Corporation, which aims to construct a 312 kilometer transmission line scheme, connecting Nepal with India.  Whilst little has been confirmed as to the actual amount that this particular transmission line will cost, we know that the project is made up of three key transmission lines, and the overall estimated cost of the project is 228 million.  We can therefore estimate that the cost will be roughly a third of the overall project budget, at approximately $76 million. Funding for the project will be partially funded as a result of Nepal signing an MOA with the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which created the MCC Nepal Compact. This affected area (Bojheni) is primarily home to the Tamang community and their traditions and livelihoods. Therefore, the construction of this project poses a huge risk to the community, and their rights', 'The Tamang Indigenous peoples use the lands in Bojheni to practice customary and spiritual rituals walled Choho which are nearing extension in other Tamang settlements. These practices will be threatened, as will the Tamang communities’ cultural heritage and practices. 500 households on the site of the proposed substation will be affected.   A preliminary list that has been published by Senior Officer Hari Krishna Upretty lists some 50 settlements of 18 wards that will be affected.  Furthermore, the NEA had not disclosed the plans to build a power line through the middle of the Taang settlement, even though in doing so, the constriction will displace the community that currently resides on that land. Furthermore, according to the Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project Victims Committee, landowners were not afforded information about the project in their native language.  According to reports, the initial planned location for the substation was Mandandeupur in Kavre, however these plans were changed without consulting locals, who were uninformed about the potential for this change of plans, nor the location of the meeting for them to voice their dissent. Locals are adamant that they do not want a substation to be built in Bojheni. Local level government has been accused of apathy towards these concerns and demands of locals.', 'Protests have been carried out against the proposed building of the transmission lines and substations in Bojheni. The NEA forcefully initiated a survey on the 1st January 2023, which was met with community protests, that lasted over a week. The response was state and police brutality, and the arrest of community members, with armed police also threatening community members at gunpoint, and manhandled and injured at least a dozen people. The Struggle Committee and Ward office have also submitted multiple forms of correspondence to the NEA and the Ministry of Energy urging them to reconsider the location of the transmission lines, however, these demands have not been effectively addressed.   The managing director of the NEA has publicly admitted that the process for obtaining consent from locals was weak. A meeting was subsequently held with affected communities and the NEA, where a three point plan was drafted to remove security forces from Bojheni, to stop the survey work until a consensus was reached, and for protests to be suspended.  However, despite a lack of consensus being watched, and the need for lands to be acquired for the project to proceed, the MCC Nepal Nepal Compact has since gone into its implementation phase, and the project has been opened for potential bids. However, it was announced in 2023 that all MCC contracts have been cancelled, due to the MCA-Nepal’s inability to procure lands in a timely manner, and concerns expressed by the finance minister regarding the unsustainably high cost of the project.', 'ILO Convention No. 169 (Ratified by Nepal 2007)\r\n-         Art 7(1) affirms the rights of Indigenous Peoples “to decide their own priorities for the process of development” and to “participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly”\r\n-        Art 14 (1) mandates recognition of Indigenous Peoples “rights of ownership and possession” over the lands they “traditionally occupy.” This includes “lands not exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and traditional activities.”\r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\r\n-        A26- asserts the right of Indigenous Peoples to ‘the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired’\r\n-        A 23 affirms the right of indigenous peoples “to determine and develop priorities and strategies for exercising their right to development.”\r\n-        A32 tates that ‘States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free and informed consent prior to the approval of any project affecting their lands or territories and other resources, particularly in connection with the development, utilization or exploitation of mineral, water or other resources’\r\n-        A 28(1) states that “indigenous peoples have the right to redress, by means that can include restitution or, when this is not possible, just, fair and equitable compensation, for the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned or otherwise occupied or used, and which have been confiscated, taken, occupied, used or damaged without their free, prior and informed consent.”\r\n-        A28(2) states that t “unless otherwise freely agreed upon by the peoples concerned, compensation shall take the form of lands, territories and resources equal in quality, size and legal status or of monetary compensation or other appropriate redress.”\r\nUN Declaration on the Right to Development \r\n-        A1(1) defines the right to development an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development\r\nThe Constitution of Nepal\r\n-        A51(b)(1) requires the Nepalese Government to ‘implement international treaties, agreements to which Nepal is a party’\r\n-        A51(j)(8)- states the necessity to ‘make the indigenous nationalities (Aadibasi Janajati) participate in decisions concerning that community by making special provisions for opportunities and benefits in order to ensure the right of these nationalities to live with dignity, along with their identity, and protect and promote traditional knowledge, skill, culture, social tradition and experience of the indigenous nationalities and local communities’', 'Lapsiphedi in Northern Kathmandu to Ratmate in Nuwakot', '$76 Million', 'Tamang Communities', '2015', 'The Ministry of Energy, The Government of Nepal', 'The Struggle Committee, The Upper Tamakoshi Hydropower Project Victims Committee', 'n/a', '2024-03-11 22:32:09', '2024-03-11 22:32:09'),

It is a multipurpose project, consisting of Hydropower and Irrigation components.', 'The Bheri Babai Project was listed as a National Pride project by the Government of Nepal in 2011.  It is a multipurpose project, consisting of Hydropower and Irrigation components.   It is in Chiple, Bheriganga Municipality, Surkhet, and includes a tunnel bored through the Siwaliks mountain chain, to Hattikhal, Bardiya. The project will be funded by the Nepalese government, as has been allocated Ps 1.49 billion, which equates to $11,191,093.  The Bheri-Babai Diversion Multipurpose Project company model is endorsed by the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources, and Irrigation.  Despite being a national pride project, development has been very slow, spanning over a decade, due to natural disasters, Covid-19, and dissent from locals.  Locals in particular have continuously protested the project in areas such as Lekbesi, Bheriganga and Gurbhakot municipalities.  The Surkhet region is also home to the nomadic Raute indigenous tribe.', 'The project has been plagued with issues regarding compensation and proper recognition of project affected locals. This is due to the fact that villages have been incorrectly taken off the list of projects affected areas, following project conducted land surveys that were carried out without consulting locals.  More that one hundred families have been negatively affected by the project, despite the inaccurate findings of the project reports.  The current compensation is being offered to families whose property would be inundated by the project, however 80 families currently do not have land ownership certificates, so are being overlooked.  Furthermore, the compensation offered to locals was decided without their input. This has resulted in inadequate funds being offered even though displaced locals will lose access to their livelihoods that were traditionally derived from farming, and future employment opportunities are not secured.  Not only this, but compensation payments have been late, and oftentimes, are not paid in full.  To this day, this continues to cause uncertainty for locals. Over one hundred families in the Bheriganga, Gurbhakot and Lekbesi are yet to receive compensation.  Though this uncertainty is largely due to land ownership disputes arising from a lack of land ownership, the information Officer and Senior Divisional Engineer of the Project has stated that 22.81 hectares of land owned families who lack the accompanying documentation will be compensated.   Despite this declaration, little initiative has been taken by the Government of Nepal, who have yet to make any official decision regarding the land in question. This has added to the uncertainty locals face regarding their future homes and livelihoods', 'Landowners have formed multiple activist groups to protest the land grabs and demand accurate and timely compensation. For example, the Land Coordination Committee has been formed to advocate for those who are in danger of losing land without compensation and have generated awareness for the issue by communicating with national media outlets.   Locals have also formed a Bheri-Babai Diversion Concern Committee, with the intention of bringing all affected communities together to protest for their rights. In November 2019, a 23 point plan was submitted by the committee to the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers through the District Administration Office, in response to families being removed from the list of recognized project affected locals.   Whilst locals’ demands continue to be recognized but improperly addressed, the local protests, along with other factors such as Covid-19 and adverse weather has continuously delayed the project', 'ILO Convention No. 169 (Ratified by Nepal 2007)\r\n-        Art 7(1) affirms the rights of Indigenous Peoples “to decide their own priorities for the process of development” and to “participate in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of plans and programmes for national and regional development which may affect them directly” * \r\n-        Art 14 (1) mandates recognition of Indigenous Peoples “rights of ownership and possession” over the lands they “traditionally occupy.” This includes “lands not exclusively occupied by them, but to which they have traditionally had access for their subsistence and traditional activities.”\r\nUN Declaration on the Right to Development\r\n-         A1(1) defines the right to development an inalienable human right by virtue of which every human person and all peoples are entitled to participate in, contribute to, and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development\r\nNepal’s Right to Information Act 2007 \r\n-        3.

Once completed, the project is predicted to include a gravity dam, headrace tunnels, a fish pass, feeder tunnels, surge and pressure shafts, and silt flushing tunnels. The project has faced controversy throughout it&rsquo;s planning and finance obtaining, currently the project developers who have been granted the contract for the dam is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/05/09/supreme-court-opens-for-door-gmr-to-continue-works-towards-financial-closure-to-develop-upper-karnali-hydropower-project\" target=\"_blank\">GMR Group</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the lack of funding has presented huge and continuous problems for the project, it is currently in the <a href=\"https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/projects/upper-karnali-hydropower-project-nepal\" target=\"_blank\">proposal stage for funding</a>&nbsp;from the Asian Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, JICA, CDC, and Nepal Investment Bank. &nbsp;The GMR group (Grandhi Mallikarjua Rao) is an Indian company, who signed the Project Development Agreement in 2014, with the intention to export the power from Nepal to Bangladesh through India, with Nepal set to receive<a href=\"https://www.sasec.asia/index.php?page=news&amp;nid=1106&amp;url=upper-karnali-trilateral-energy&amp;enews=73\" target=\"_blank\"> 27% free equity</a>. &nbsp;The estimated cost of the project is &nbsp;$1.5 billion, however, due to continuous delays in the project, there has been little progress in terms of building or funding legitimate and updated preliminary environmental and social studies. However, we know that farmers and local fishing communities in the areas will be directly affected, such as Asarghat, Sisne, Thalpata, Surkhet, Ramaghat, Saura, Salkot and Daba.</p>', '<p>The delays in finance procurement and project progression mean that we do not know the full extent of the impact that will be felt as the result of the project. However, it is worth noting that &nbsp; the corporate social responsibility arm of GMR held a three-month training program in Delhi for locals of Karnali, who stood to be affected by the project. 16 men and 7 women were offered skills-based courses, including welding and basic computer skills. Furthermore, upstream communities reportedly are enthusiastic at the prospect of the project and the opportunities being advertised because of the project. There is a general expectation that business opportunities will be created as a result of the project, meaning migration into India would be less required for job opportunities. Though 426 stand to have their incomes from fishing and other river based activities jeopardized, there is still much support from these communities for the project to go ahead. &nbsp;Furthermore, the promise of compensation for communities whose land falls directly within the scope of the project has been offered and advertised compensation, infrastructural developments. In fact, the communities reportedly negotiated a higher price for their land than the designated government price, and initial offer from the GMR group. This set off a rush of <a href=\"https://www.sharesansar.com/newsdetail/upper-karnali-hydropower-project-sets-off-land-rush\" target=\"_blank\">buying land around the project area</a> to then sell off for a higher price to the project administrators. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nFurther downstream is an alarmingly different story, however. There is far lower frequency contact made with the communities downstream, and the hindered river flow threatens their entire way of life, in a way that they argue cannot be accommodated for with the introduction of electricity. This impact could reach around <a href=\"https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/energy/nepal-hydropower/\" target=\"_blank\">10&rsquo;000 communities</a> downstream and could impact the biodiversity of the river and its surroundings. &nbsp;These impacts could reach communities as far as Badi village, who have stated that whikst they are currently food secure, this would impact their farming, livelihoods and ways of life. Despite this, <a href=\"https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/energy/nepal-hydropower/\" target=\"_blank\">GMR has ignored</a> their needs and demands, as they are situated far from the dam. &nbsp;This deficiency in FPIC and meaningful consultation afforded to communities who are geologically further removed from the project site, despite the detrimental impact the project will have on their land, livelihood and cultural traditions, amounts to a clear violation of indigenous rights. There is also contention regarding the compensation that was promised to communities. GMR claims that 250 families whose land was submerged was offered compensation, yet <a href=\"https://nepalitimes.com/banner/dams-and-dreams-a-journey-down-the-karnali\" target=\"_blank\">locals state</a> that few people have actually seen the money they were pledged. &nbsp;The financial trouble surrounding the project furthermore makes it seem unlikely that this compensation will be seen by its deserved recipients anytime soon. This situation has been exacerbated by reports of corruption, with the project only paying out to politically influential people. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nFinally, worries are being expressed about the impact that, if this project goes ahead without proper environmental impact assessments, the history and quality of the river, as well as 7 native species of fish, and some 14&rsquo;826 species of insect, will be <a href=\"http://www.hakahakionline.com/en/8803/lets-join-hands-to-save-karnali-river/&quot;\" target=\"_blank\">put at risk</a>. &nbsp;The chairman of the Youth Alliance for the Environment has expressed his <a href=\"http://www.hakahakionline.com/en/8803/lets-join-hands-to-save-karnali-river/\" target=\"_blank\">concern</a> that the EIA&rsquo;s carried out have been carried out by unqualified people, and is additionally concerned that the findings of these assessments have not been made public.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>', '<p>There is evidence to indicate that communities have been able to mobilize and advocate for higher compensation standards from the GMR group. Upstream, more local communities to the project, formed Upper Karnali Concern Committees in 2012, in response to the MOU signed between the Government of Nepal and the GMR in 2008, and a project report competed in 2011. These upstream UKCC&rsquo;s would reportedly <a href=\"https://www.thethirdpole.net/en/energy/nepal-hydropower/\" target=\"_blank\">mobilize</a> to protest the plans and padlock the offices, amongst other things, to force the GMR group to take their demands seriously. &nbsp; However, as mentioned, this compensation is currently incomplete in its payment, with circumstances surrounding the agreement becoming more precarious. Furthermore, for locals downstream, it was far more common to have their concerns ignored.&nbsp;<br />\r\nLocal residents of the project did however lodge a writ petition at the Supreme Court in January 2023 following the Government of Nepal&rsquo;s decision to extend the deadline for GMR to secure financial closure. This followed over a d<a href=\"https://myrepublica.nagariknetwork.com/news/gmr-given-two-more-years-to-complete-financial-management-of-upper-karnali-hydro-project/\" target=\"_blank\">ecade of delays</a> and uncertainty and misinformation to locals regarding the progression of the project, and the impacts it would have. &nbsp;The Supreme Court initially issued an interim order that suspended the government&rsquo;s decision. However, the government of Nepal responded with a movement to vacate the order to allow the project to move forward.
